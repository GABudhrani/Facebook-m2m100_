$10,000 Gold?
SAN FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
Lately, with gold prices up more than 300% over the last decade, it is harder than ever.
Just last December, fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment, sensibly pointing out gold’s risks.
Wouldn’t you know it?
Since their articles appeared, the price of gold has moved up still further. Gold prices even hit a record-high $1,300 recently.
Last December, many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $2,000.
Now, emboldened by continuing appreciation, some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that.
One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980’s.
Since then, the index has climbed above 10,000.
Now that gold has crossed the magic $1,000 barrier, why can’t it increase ten-fold, too?
Admittedly, getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems.
After adjusting for inflation, today’s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980. Back then, gold hit $850, or well over $2,000 in today’s dollars.
But January 1980 was arguably a “freak peak” during a period of heightened geo-political instability.
At $1,300, today’s price is probably more than double very long-term, inflation-adjusted, average gold prices.
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here?
One answer, of course, is a complete collapse of the US dollar.
With soaring deficits, and a rudderless fiscal policy, one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press.
And if you are really worried about that, gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge.
Sure, some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold.
But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.
In fact, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt, precisely so that its value might be inflated away.
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
So it can happen anywhere.
Even so, the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable, so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations.
Some have argued instead that gold’s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold.
There is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of irony – to this argument.
After all, medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold.
Wouldn’t it be paradoxical, then, if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more?
In my view, the most powerful argument to justify today’s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy.
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably rises, driving up the price of scarce commodities.
At the same time, emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves, which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks.
With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar, gold’s appeal has naturally grown.
So, yes, there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today’s higher gold price, although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future.
Indeed, another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization.
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements.
After all, gold pays no interest and even costs something to store.
Today, with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries, it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds.
But if real interest rates rise significantly, as well they might someday, gold prices could plummet.
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term, with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance.
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends.
Yes, gold has had a great run, but so, too, did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago.
If you are a high-net-worth investor, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank, it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events.
But, despite gold’s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price, it remains a very risky bet for most of us.
Of course, such considerations might have little influence on prices.
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today: gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile.
A Conservative Europe
Last week Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin.
They departed pledging to revive Europe's growth. We've heard that empty promise before.
Instead, the European Union needs a new direction.
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain's engagement with Europe.
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960's.
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973.
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986.
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union.
But British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states.
Faced with a new EU initiative, our traditional response has often been to oppose it, vote against it, lose the vote, then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else.
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes. So am I.
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept.
Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market; free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy, far less a common taxation policy.
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness.
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours.
Which areas should be applied to every member state, and which should be optional?
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states.
In areas which serve their national interest, individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co‑operate with others.
The Union's members should form a series of overlapping circles: different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing.
Precedents exist for this.
NATO has been flexible since its inception.
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO's central command.
Similar flexibility exists with the Euro, the Schengen Agreement, and the Social Chapter.
These precedents can be extended.
So far, everyone has had to move forward together, with individual countries negotiating specific opt‑outs.
But since 1998, there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co‑operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member.
Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt‑out of a new initiative, those that support it can simply opt‑in.
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
They don't need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them.
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations.
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe. That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey.
I don't want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to. But I don't want to block their way.
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely.
But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end.
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken.
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out.
Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro, or hope for its failure.
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively.
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions, within the EU framework.
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution.
We disagree with many of its contents, of course, but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all.
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty, and a single entity, whether you call it a state or not, with its own legal personality, deriving its authority from its own constitution.
If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form, the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood: its own president and foreign minister, its own legal system.
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra‑national constitution.
That is a radical change, not the mere tidying‑up exercise some suggest.
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern.
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties.
They safeguard them, and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate.
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state.
­A New European Growth Agenda
BRUSSELS – Austerity alone cannot solve Europe's economic and financial crisis.
Growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal.
European Union leaders now recognize this: kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council’s meeting on January 30.
But the big question remains: How?
The need for immediate action is clear.
The eurozone’s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011; even Germany’s shrank.
The new year is looking grim.
France is flat-lining (as is Britain).
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession.
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump.
And eurozone unemployment is at record highs, with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece.
The economic headwinds are formidable: fiscal austerity, high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries, credit cutting by banks, deleveraging households, weak private-sector investment, and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand.
Until growth resumes, any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile.
Recession will hit banks’ and governments’ already-weak balance sheets, increasing pressure for faster deleveraging.
But, while gradual adjustment is essential, faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating: big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown – and thus a vicious downward spiral.
A big new push for growth is therefore vital.
So far, the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms, which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility.
The crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately (one exception is permitting shops to open longer).
On the contrary, a shakeout of less productive jobs, for example, would at first raise unemployment, increase government outlays, and reduce private spending.
And, because demand is depressed, credit is in short supply, and barriers to enterprise are often high, it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs.
In short, structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012.
Instead, the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit – such as France, Italy, and Spain (and the United Kingdom) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.
The European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks; now it needs to support the real economy, too.
While official interest rates are only 1%, solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5% to borrow for ten years, while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates, if at all.
So the ECB should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy; the European Banking Authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9% ratio; and, where necessary, national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses.
While improving access to finance is vital, governments also need to do more to boost investment.
They should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business, lift barriers to venture capital, and introduce temporary 100% capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment.
At the EU level, the (callable) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased, as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September, so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment, notably in infrastructure.
Boosting exports is also essential.
Deficit countries need to become more competitive, increasing productivity while cutting costs.
A more competitive currency would be welcome: just as the sterling’s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports, a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports.
A fiscal devaluation – slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT – would also help.
Surplus countries, too, must do their part, which is in their own interest.
Just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise, so Germany – whose current-account surplus exceeds China's both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms – needs a higher real exchange rate.
That means that Germans need to earn higher wages, commensurate with their increased productivity, so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays.
If businesses will not oblige, an income-tax cut would do the trick.
That brings us to fiscal policy.
Governments that cannot borrow cheaply (or at all) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts.
But they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity.
So they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure, while cutting subsidies and transfer payments.
They should also legislate now for future reforms, notably to encourage people to work longer.
Last but not least, governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates – 0% in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany – must play their role in supporting demand.
Would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year?
Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan?
At the onset of the US-led war in Iraq, two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome. The first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally.
Derided by detractors as a new "domino theory," this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America's role in post-WWII Japan.
Against the optimism of that "Japan scenario," pessimists argued that a "Somalia scenario" was more likely.
They staked their claim on the tribal, sectarian, and multiethnic nature of Iraq, which, in the absence of dictatorship, would supposedly incite Iraq's collapse into a "failed state," with rampant warlordism, ethnic and religious feuds, and harboring of terrorist organizations.
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios, increasingly resembling Afghanistan.
This "Afghan scenario" implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government.
Bad as it sounds, this prospect appears to be a "realistic" compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing, unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state.
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions, seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced.
Indeed, such hopes were misplaced.
Iraq's political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy: notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking, the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted, and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community.
On the other hand, much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the "traditional" nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy.
For these analyses are hardly neutral, but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation.
In Iraq, as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds, a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms: grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding (nationalism, socialism, Islamism), versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience.
The frontlines of this war are notions of the individual, cultural identity, civil society, and the nation-state.
The religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated. But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it.
Nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system, but they are not its sole components.
Indeed, the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of "democracy" and "human rights" as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle.
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene.
There are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context.
Advocates of the notion of "Arab exceptionalism," which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with "grand narrative" ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world's patronage-based political order.
The models used in the West, both in political circles and in academia, for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient.
In particular, many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model, reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented "reality" of separate communities.
Some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its "genuine" original components: Sunni, Shi`i, and Kurd.
In fact, Iraqi society is more complex than this.
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging, but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical, cultural, religious, and political identities of Iraqi individuals.
Given the right circumstances, it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be.
The fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances.
Indeed, the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam's dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society.
Upon Saddam's fall, a large "middle ground" existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice.
Policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground, opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba`athism.
The key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground.
As a result, the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded.
But to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy.
The CPA, and the world community, must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society.
Even if such efforts succeed, the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive.
But instead of succumbing to a "Somalia scenario," dreaming of a "Japan scenario," or settling for an "Afghanistan scenario," Iraq may yet become a "scenario" for successful intervention in the 21 st century.
“Neo-Ottoman” Turkey?
ANKARA – Nowadays, the international media are obsessed with the question of who “lost” Turkey and what that supposed loss means for Europe and the West.
More alarmingly, some commentators liken Turkey’s neighborhood policy to a revival of Ottoman imperialism.
Recently, a senior Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as saying that “we are indeed neo-Ottoman.”
As someone who was present when Davutoğlu made his presentation to the parliamentary faction of Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), I can attest to the fact that he did not use such terminology.
In fact, Davutoğlu and all of us in the AKP foreign-policy community never use this term, because it is simply a mispresentation of our position.
Turkey’s neighborhood policy is devised to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhoods, including the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and the Eastern Mediterranean.
We aim to deepen our political dialogue, increase our trade, and multiply our people-to-people contacts with our neighbors in the form of sports, tourism, and cultural actvities.
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960’s, no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost.
God bestowed upon Turkey a geographical position that fundamentally requires for us to engage with East and West, North and South.
This is neither a choice nor a luxury – it is a necessity.
The symbol of the Byzantine and the Selçuk Empires, which occupied roughly the same geography that Turkey does today, was a double-headed eagle looking both east and west.
It should be no wonder that Turkey is also seeking to engage both ends of its territories and feels that its security is best consolidated by minimizing risks together with its neighbors.
So we find the current debate on Turkey’s orientation rather superflous, and in some cases ill-intentioned.
Our neighborhood policy needs support, not criticism.
Turkey has become an invaluable asset in the make-up of our surrounding regions, and is already changing the status quo in favor of more stability and predictability.
Our efforts at normalization with Armenia, for example, are destined to bring change to the entire South Caucasus.
We are doing our part in terms of burden-sharing.
Sensible Europeans understand that.
To be sure, some of our neighbors are difficult.
But no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors.
Turkey’s neighborhood policy is very realistic, based on genuine interests, not some romantic neo-Ottoman nostagia, as more than a few international commentators have suggested.
True, there is a neo-Ottoman revival in the cultural field, and our citizens are eager to rediscover Ottoman life, culture, and practices.
As Turkey is normalizing domestically, it is also reinterpreting its national historical narrative.
This is a natural byproduct of consolidating our democracy.
However, trying to paint our carefully constructed foreign-policy initiatives with imperialist overtones is not only a stark mispresentation, but also does gross injustice to our well-intentioned efforts to stabilize our region.
In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of gates, doorways, beginnings, and endings.
Turkey today is a Janus-like geography that offers gates and doorways to the East and West.
It offers beginnings and endings to the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean.
In this capacity, Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transitional passage between otherwise difficult regions, for it signifies centuries-old co-existence and adjustment.
Turkish foreign policy contributes to that coming together and helps its immeditate neighborhoods to connect with one another.
Contrary to recent charges, Turkey’s foreign policymakers are not seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire.
Instead, we seek Turkey’s historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhoods, thereby correcting an anomaly of the Cold War years.
Such re-integration would only benefit the European Union and our other Western, NATO allies.
None of them, therefore, has any reason to express discomfort with Turkey.
Why Wait for the Euro?
Although the EU's eastward enlargement has not yet happened, the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow: when should the new, predominantly postcommunist, members adopt the euro?
Assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty's provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry. 
At the outset, it must be stressed that, in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed.
Early entry, otherwise, would be an empty gesture. 
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible, but preferable to delay.
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
Assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004, new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006. 
Is this realistic?
Well, most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU.
Exports to the Union have soared since 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets.
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece, Portugal, and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU. 
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive.
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5% - not much higher than in many EU countries, and lower than in The Netherlands last year.
As with structural convergence, EU candidates already outperform Spain, Portugal, and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut.
Nor is there much risk of large, future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized. 
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows.
The culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called "Balassa-Samuelson" effect: rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates' tradable sectors - export manufacturing, for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies, including in non-tradable sectors like services.
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average. 
The Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece, Spain and Portugal.
But as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates, its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2%.
With the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation, the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5% of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach. 
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership?
From the standpoint of current member states, would admitting Hungary, Latvia, Poland, or Slovakia, sooner rather than later, drag down the euro as many fear? 
Fears that extending EMU to new states "too soon" would undermine the euro's external exchange rate are irrational.
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time, they will together account for a mere 6% of its total GDP.
So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error. 
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information.
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise.
Equally, the transition period is already turbulent, with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
Indeed, capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15% fluctuation band either side of a central parity. 
Some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves.
The benefit is simple: ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility, as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro.
This would help keep the candidates' economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels. 
This is an exceptionally weak argument, and a politically suspect one, too.
As European Central Bank data shows, average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44% of the eurozone level.
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry, probably lasting several decades.
More important, long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed (EMU) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms. 
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms.
In almost all candidates, further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation, more flexible labor markets, and completion of privatization.
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms. 
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear.
Early adoption, by contrast, would be more conducive to these reforms, and thus to real convergence.
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency, reduced transaction costs, and a solid macroeconomic framework.
This strategy, not one of deferred entry, promises the most for both the EU's current and its future members. 
1929 or 1989?
PARIS – As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening.
At the start of the crisis, many people likened it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns.
Today, the mood is much grimmer, with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound, even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional.
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro, whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms.
For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989.
Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Indeed, on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis: the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism.
Yet 2008-2009, like 1989, may very well correspond to an epochal change, whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades.
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.
And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies.
In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc.
For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.
Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and now.
First, and perhaps above all, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity. By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union.
Second, whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989, it is difficult in 2009, with the spread of the global crisis, to distinguish winners from losers.
Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.
Yet, history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today’s global crisis, may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass.
In better shape, but not alone.
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes.
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard, Asians – Chinese and Indians, in particular – are everywhere, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much, and whom they would overcome in the coming decades.
But before this new order appears, the world may be faced with spreading disorder, if not outright chaos.
What, for example, will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “European dream” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe’s supposedly open countries?
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers, including me, would have assumed.
We can only hope that, in the end, the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be.
9/11 in Perspective
NEW YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission.
In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them.
September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point.
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace.
On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated.
Despite the attention devoted to the “Global War on Terrorism,” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies, globalization, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political upheavals in the Middle East. 
As for the future, it is much more likely to be defined by the United States’ need to put its economic house in order; China’s trajectory within and beyond its borders; and the ability of the world’s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth, stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, and meeting energy and environmental challenges.
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.
They can destroy but not create.
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.
Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists.
Intelligence assets have been redirected.
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.
International cooperation has increased markedly, in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area.
Military force has played a role as well.
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.
Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders.
Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.
But progress is not to be confused with victory.
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals.
Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas.
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world’s other most dangerous terrorists.
A mixture of instability, government weakness, and ideology in countries such as Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize, train, and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago.
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.
The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world.
The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today: “Are we capturing, killing, or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training, and deploying against us?” All things being equal, we probably are.
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so.
What is to be done?
Alas, there is no single or silver bullet.
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state, any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India.
Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty.
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done.
Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so.
But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism.
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this.
Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police.
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency.
A “Portfolio” Approach to Climate Change
The world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty, due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009.
Campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies, but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality.
The new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts, because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research efforts.
New research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge, but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });First, we now know that adaptation will be essential, because temperatures will rise by another 0.6°C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow.
We also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe.
In some areas, modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and/or irrigation remains viable.
Even with 0.6°C warming, however, Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and, eventually, increased vulnerability to infectious disease.
These impacts will clearly hit the planet’s worst-off inhabitants hardest: the “bottom billion” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease, poverty, conflict and malnutrition.&#160;
Ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge.
Long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens’ health, but in the meantime the planet’s poorest people will need help from the rich.
Our analysis investigated, for example, the merits of more targeted policies for the near term: purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change.
The goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming.
Benefits would appear almost immediately, but would dissipate over time as economies developed.
Even as development improves conditions, however, reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe.
Since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world, thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere.
But we found that mitigationalone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test.
We allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global GDP through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $18 billion.
The discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $800 billion, but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $685 billion.
The Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
We allocated $50 billion to research into greener technology, so that only $750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation.
The gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell, and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective.
As a result, the research and development program essentially paid for itself, and total discounted benefits for the $800 billion investment climbed to more than $2.1 trillion.&#160;
Ensuring that research and development is part of the world’s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century.
But these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would “come onboard.”
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would, for example, increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three.
Expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages, even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities, which would push in the opposite direction.
Fighting climate change can be a sound investment, even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to “solve” the problem.
To make a real difference, especially in the near term, the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology, which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives.
A “Reset” Button for Europe’s Backyard
STOCKHOLM – One year after the war in Georgia of last August, pushing the “reset” button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays.
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to “reset” strained United States-Russian ties.
The European Union, though not in need of a “reset” because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors, is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations.
When the EU launched its new “Eastern Partnership” in May, the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union’s six immediate eastern neighbors – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU’s eastern neighborhood an urgent need.
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The Eastern Partnership – originating from a Polish/Swedish initiative – offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas.
In trade and economic relations, it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries.
It confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal (with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime), promises enhanced cooperation on energy security, diversification, and efficiency, and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas.
Sweden’s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts.
However, it comes at a time when the Union’s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges, with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard.
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade, severely undermining its steel industry.
Georgia’s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment, for which there is hardly any appetite today.
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market, such as Moldova, have seen the crisis arrive more slowly, but the real effect might be equally as bad, and they are likely to recover more slowly.
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis.
But it can provide a political framework and institution-building support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis: imperfect market economies, weak state institutions, and continued corruption.
The Eastern Partnership’s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power.
The other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political.
In most of these countries, democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country’s stability.
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.
Political association with the EU, and the process of integration under this Partnership, will promote reforms in these key areas.
The Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work – the nuts and bolts – of the Partnership.
The establishment of “Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs,” designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country, should take place before the year’s end.
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well, and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed.
Here, Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs, which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs, but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
The Swedish Presidency, together with the European Commission, intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn.
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation, as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries.
At the end of the year, a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead.
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration, about the six countries moving closer to the EU’s values, legislation, and ways of working, and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence.
In Russia, there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it.
But this, of course, is untrue.
On the contrary, Russia, like Turkey, will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership’s multilateral dimensions.
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing.
Nevertheless, it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform – a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region.
A “Third Way” for Confronting Russia
PARIS – “Let’s engage Russia if we can, but contain it if we must.”
These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990’s.
Since then, Russia may have changed dramatically, but not our questions about it.
What do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture, which is European, and its political system, which is becoming increasingly “Asian,” at least in the bad old sense of “Oriental despotism”?
Should the best answer to the return of Russia’s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world’s new maverick?
Or is a latter-day Yalta Conference, aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe, necessary?
Could the answer be a bit of both?
If Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon, or reverting to Soviet form – shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest – what is needed is not the “league of democracies” advocated by some conservatives in America.
What is needed, instead, is a “stability league” that includes prominent actors like China, India, and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in “rocking the boat” of the international system.
Such a strategy implies, first of all, a solid partnership with China, not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy, but because it is a status-quo power.
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran, and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO.
The message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear.
“Do not fool yourself. Nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment.
Europe may be weak and divided, America may no longer be what it was, but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas, you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers. China is; you are not.”
But the containment argument fails, because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner.
More importantly, rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia’s great power pretensions too seriously.
For example, many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe, but no longer for the world.
At the Cold War’s end, Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union.
Today, the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia.
The other alternative to a rebirth of “containment” would consist in accepting the Russian argument, or more precisely, Russian “emotions.”
It would mean saying, in effect, “We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years.
From NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo, we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests.
Let’s sit down together like Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe.
What do you want back?
What do we keep?”
This approach might recognize Russia’s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus.
Indeed, while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy’s France, which currently holds the EU presidency, Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia’s dismemberment.
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president’s irresponsible behavior.
As for Ukraine, it may one day become part of the European Union, but its future is not in NATO.
Yet, between all-out containment, which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic, and accommodation which borders on appeasement, which would be dangerous for Europe’s future, a third way, based on a few firm principles, must be found.
These principles are clear. First, Ukraine’s territorial integrity is not negotiable.
This has been said many times, but repetition does not diminish its importance.
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire.
Second, even if the West condemns Georgia’s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia’s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories, the Kremlin’s shameless brutality is unacceptable.
After all, this is Europe more than six decades after World War II, and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation’s will upon another cannot be accepted passively.
In the short term, time may be on Russia’s side.
In the long run – economically, demographically, politically, strategically – time is on “our” side, if we stick to our values and our principles.
A Bad Deal for America’s Future
WASHINGTON, DC – The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America’s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending, thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States.
But the agreement has three major flaws.
Two of them offset each other, but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years: economic growth.
The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed: coming as they do when the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession.
The measure’s second shortcoming, however, is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest.
While the legislation does too little to address America’s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited.
The third and most damaging flaw, however, is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places.
Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving, intact, America’s principal welfare programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, the legislation does not touch either of them.
These programs’ costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation – those born between 1946 and 1964 – retires and collects benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead.
And, because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes, any time, under any circumstances, the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the wealthiest Americans – for the deficit reduction that it provides.
All of the spending cuts come from the “discretionary” part of the federal budget, which excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor, and interest on the national debt.
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut, and much of that goes to the defense budget, which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future.
So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget, which is only about 10% of it.
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead.
Worse yet, discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for America’s future prosperity and global standing.
Growth is, in the first place, the best way to reduce the country’s budget deficits.
The higher the growth rate, the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits.
Moreover, economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enormously important to individual Americans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one, the popular term for which is “the American dream.”
Just as important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a crucial factor in America's economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership, which dates back to the founding of the country, that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation.
That partnership has five components: wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills; investment in infrastructure – roads, power plants, and ports – that supports commerce; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America’s borders; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth.
The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money, and that money is included in the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation.
Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term, with negative consequences both at home and abroad.
Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education, infrastructure, and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers. Most of the weight will remain, and one’s life prospects will have worsened significantly.
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way.
Unless more deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues, and less from programs vital for economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US – and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.
A Better and Safer Europe
To many, myself included, NATO's enlargement to take in, among others, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true.
When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago, expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people.
Until recently, Russia's robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle, because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called "near abroad" as a zone of special interest and influence.
NATO's enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country's "zone."
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors (Hitler's Reich and Stalin's USSR), which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated.
By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics, Europe is made a safer place, and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO's political values, including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities.
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement.
Rightly so: enlargement of NATO is not an "expansion" that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms.
On the contrary, expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union.
The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law, due in no small part to NATO demands.
Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia, Europe, and America now work out their disagreements.
Indeed, enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
This small piece of Russia, with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea, is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, two future members of the EU.
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper.
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime.
This, in turn, created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia.
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion is clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in, thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002.
But this is no cause for complacency. For the really hard work is only now beginning: dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring, as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms, in particular Russia.
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety.
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly.
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights.
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations.
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave.
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad's fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures.
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow.
In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU, where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea.
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself.
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams.
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true.
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe.
A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risks
In 1977, when I served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department, I was sent to India to dissuade that country's leaders from developing a nuclear bomb.
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China.
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe.
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology.
So far as we know, its leaders have kept their word.
But revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan's bomb, confirm the danger I predicted back then.
Some call Khan's network an effort to spread an "Islamic bomb," but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran, it might better be termed a corrupt bomb.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });As events in Pakistan illustrate, the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence.
Rather, it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons.
That makes everyone less safe.
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, or any city they chose.
Now the world's attention is focussed on Iran, one recipient of Pakistani technology, as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August, and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities.
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy, but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium.
Last October, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures.
In addition, after visits by the French, British, and German foreign ministers, Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program.
Now it hints that it may resume enrichment, and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA.
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
Correct, because the NPT was born with a loophole.
Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections, it can legally accumulate enriched uranium (or reprocessed plutonium) under the guise of a peaceful energy program, and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice.
If Iran did this, it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region, but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide.
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons.
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others.
For these reasons, President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable.
However, America's unilateral options are limited.
Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq, but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility, making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent. In the mid-1970's, many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
Realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime, countries as diverse as the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Japan formed a "Nuclear Suppliers Group" that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it.
Today, such countries should join together to offer Iran (and others) a deal.
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel.
For example, Russia, which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor's spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing.
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council.
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace, and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions.
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle.
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear.
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services.
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan.
A Big Chance for Small Farmers
NEW YORK – The G-8’s $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group’s recent summit in L’Aquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.
With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar.
Indeed, the new initiative, combined with others in health, education, and infrastructure, could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015 .
During 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
One cornerstone of the project was “smallholder farmers,” meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia – working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers.
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.
As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence.
Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty.
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.
The UN Millennium Project’s Hunger Task Force, led by two world-leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle.
The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers, in the form of agricultural inputs.  The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose.  Drawing on that work and related scientific findings, Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.
Many of us, notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort, and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman, and others.
Now the key is to make this effort work.
The lessons of history are clear.
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.
Not only will food yields rise in the short term, but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children’s health and education.
That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.
Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness.
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain.
Perhaps the main risk is that the “aid bureaucracies” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it gets taken up by meetings, expert consultations, overhead, reports, and further meetings.
“Partnerships” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action.
If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.
Governments in hunger-stricken regions, especially Africa, would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, farm tools, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers.
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.
Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed.
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.
This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound.
Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach: the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations, which successfully gets immunizations to young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases.
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance.
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach.
All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor.
Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works.
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world’s poorest farm families.
A Black and White Question
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene.
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.
The man refused.
He was then told to identify himself.
The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him.
He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification.
The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed. 
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast.
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.
That, too, would not have been unusual.
What made this case special was that Henry Louis “Skip” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country, famous for his books, his articles, and numerous television appearances.
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.
That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him.
Class and race overlap in the US.
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.
Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck.
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”
Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates.
As it happens, the charges were duly dropped, and there the case might have rested if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill, had not weighed in on behalf of his “friend” Gates, and called the police “stupid.”
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.
The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.
The field is too full of mines.
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.
And there remains plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, mostly black areas; the appalling healthcare system; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks, who don’t have the privilege of a Harvard ID.
It is probably true that many white policemen, even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city.
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?
One might argue that itwas.
If not Professor Gates, then who?
Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue.
If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem, or some other poor, or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard about it.
The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin.
There was no question of violence.
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.
A Bomb in Every Reactor
BERLIN – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap.
Indeed, the opposite is true.
Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and, most menacing of all, the risk of military proliferation.
Moreover, the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable.
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity; it is a deliberate political choice.
Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that, at the time, only a minority of people worldwide, largely in the West, benefited from technological progress.
By contrast, the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources, which are indispensable for human survival, are finite, and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have.
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.
The energy future of nine billion people, which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century, lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy, but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency.
We already know this.
Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?
The answer, ultimately, doesn’t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy, but first and foremost with its military applications.
The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb.
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige.
Even today, the Bomb divides the world into two classes: the few states have it, and the many that do not.
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union.
To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers, which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was framed in the 1960’s.
To this day, it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world, imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves.
Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it.
To this day, therefore, the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase, particularly given small and medium powers’ hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts.
Iran is the most current example of this.
The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous, and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists.
Despite the NPT, a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn’t always worked, or worked completely, because the NPT’s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes.
From here, then, all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders’ decision to take them.
This political power, not the requirements of energy policy, is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult.
As a rule, the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called “civilian” nuclear programs.
The supposed “civilian” nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus, for instance, led to a large number of such “civilian” programs in neighboring states.
Honni soit qui mal y pense!
And, of course, the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called “clandestine threshold countries.”
So how will the world – first and foremost, the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster?
Will the tide truly turn, propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons?
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching, fundamental choice.
It was Japan, the high-tech country par excellence (not the latter-day Soviet Union) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks.
What, then, will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities?
Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons: despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents, the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course.
Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation.
A Born-Again CAP
WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child.
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union’s future needs.
The CAP must be born again.
Work on its renewal is due to start now, with the completed project ready in 2013.
But a much more profound re-think is needed.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The CAP’s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union, which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency.
Good, healthy, and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens.
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union’s growing wealth.
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed, and food security was achieved.
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.
As the EU has evolved and expanded, food systems have become more complex, involving production, processing, supply-chain organization, and wholesale and retail distribution, with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment.
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny.
A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy, entitledGround for Choices, demonstrated that the EU’s food supply could be met with 50% less cultivated land, 80% less pesticides, and at 50% less cost.
Pollution would be reduced by 70% as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water, and greenhouse gases would be cut.
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today’s 27 members the possibilities are even greater.
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land, substantial gains could be made in food production.
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially.
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP’s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced.
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.
Thestatus quo clearly has to be changed.
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community.
But that attitude is undermining change.
Competition must be encouraged, as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community, with fewer farmers but better farms.
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner, more productive, and efficient agriculture.
A side benefit for the EU’s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization’s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe.
Moreover, the CAP’s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place.
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces, as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.
If the market “misbehaves,” farmers could be reduced to poverty, leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe.
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture’s competitiveness.
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands, substantially contributing to the development and power of the country’s agribusiness.
Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness, including horticultural seeds, ornamentals, seed potatoes, and veal, are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country’s trade balance.
In the EU as a whole, a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture’s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development.
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level, but agricultural production and land use are not among them.
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A policy for European food systems would treat production, processing, distribution, logistics, and retailing in combination.
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation’s “Forward Look on European Food Systems” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy.
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land.
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects.
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe’s landscapes.
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should it ignore cost.
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land.
These five pillars involve drastic choices, but they will probably require less money from Europe’s taxpayers, not more.
They could make a real contribution to cleaner, more productive, and efficient farming and land use, while addressing social needs.
A Boycott Against Reason
“It could happen here” is the shorthand phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypothetical scenarios.
“How could this happen here?” was the question more pertinently asked in Great Britain recently, as its universities witnessed the unfolding of an all-too-real and perplexing action.
In early June, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), Britain’s largest academic union, with 67,000 members, passed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dissociate themselves from “continuing Israeli apartheid policies.”
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The motion was subsequently revoked; but the fact that it was put forward at all is astonishing enough.
Indeed, the union’s call for a wholesale boycott contravened its most fundamental values: the principle of academic freedom, openness, and exchange; protection of research from state politics; and the fundamental right to free speech.
The motion implicitly adopted the yardstick of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyite tone, demanding a sort of “disloyalty oath” from Israeli academics.
What led scholars who are putatively the guardians of democratic freedoms to embrace measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics?
Unfortunately, the NATFHE effort is part of a larger phenomenon.
In 2005, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) called for a more limited boycott, singling out Bar Ilan and Haifa Universities for opprobrium.
Before that, a petition, signed by roughly 80 prominent British intellectuals and a few from other European countries, demanded the cessation of European Union funding for Israeli cultural projects and institutions.
These campaigns, encouraged by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organizations, have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism, and an informal boycott of Israeli scholars, publications, and cultural projects already exists in some European circles.
Such developments suggest an advanced and deeply disturbing trend, whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are willing to violate their own beliefs in order to target one state for unique stigmatization; and whereby insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state’s citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable.
In a certain ideological mind-set,Israel is perceived not as a political entity, susceptible to prevailing standards of judgment, but as an almost allegorical force, the symbolic center and source of the globe’s evils and ailments.
Of course, Israel has been guilty of both bad policies and political sins.
The occupation of Palestinian territories has had terrible consequences, and it is necessary to end it.
But in today’s intensely charged climate, the Middle East has become a kind of ideological projection screen, a magnet for tendencies to demonization and idealization.
In the putatively “radical” interpretation, the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposed interests.
Rather, the stubborn complexities of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness, the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed.
The rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme, and conducive to hatred.
Phrases like “apartheid state” and “Zionism is racism,” unthinkable in liberal discourse a few years ago, have become routine.
At the same time, the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications – one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen, prior to a meeting, draped in a Palestinian flag – and unwitting condescension.
They are seen as the last pure cause, the entirely innocent “Other,” unimplicated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice.
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions, that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation, or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence, is, in this framework, never admitted.
Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions’ motions.
This is Manicheanism of the left, and, like Manicheanism of the political right, it can distort reality to the point of becoming divorced from it.
Certainly, the boycott efforts ignored basic facts.
Unless British academics are ill informed, they know that Israel, far from being an “apartheid state,” has a large proportion of Arab citizens; that Israeli universities are well integrated, in some cases with considerable numbers of Arab students, as well as a number – admittedly small and insufficiently representative – of Arab faculty; that many universities sponsor collaborative projects with Palestinian and Arab colleagues; that they are often sites of dissidence against government policies; and that such dissidence, even in radical forms, is tolerated.
Advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with stifling legitimate criticism of Israel.
This argument is both disingenuous and dishonest.
Many of the boycotts’ critics are also critical of Israel.
But credible criticism must be based on evidence – and on generally applicable criteria of judgment.
If the British unions wanted to be ethically consistent, they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brutally abused and free speech suppressed.
Some see this hostility to Israel as camouflaging old-fashioned anti-Semitism.
It is always risky to speculate about hidden motives; nevertheless, systematic disparagement of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that anti-Semitism, too, is a permitted prejudice.
It is always easier to see a group or nation as a malevolent “Other” when this impulse is fed by an old, and still potent, prejudice.
There is a deeper issue at stake.
Democratic societies depend not only on the foundational principle of free speech, but on the character of political thought and conversation among various constituencies.
When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of those constituencies resorts to illiberal discourse and intolerant measures, tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality are reinforced.
The actions of the British academic unions have Israel as their obvious target.
But their main effect may be an erosion of reasoned debate and civil conduct, without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism.
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.
With Spain’s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world’s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap.
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.
Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it. With donor help, they can.
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.
By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa.
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.
In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production.
Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.
This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution.
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them.
Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding.
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP).
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.
Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.
The current aid structures are inadequate.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.
African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.
My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.
By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs’ administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help. 
The time for business as usual is over.
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.
Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world’s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis.
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health
NEW YORK – Every year, millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries.
In many cases, lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced, but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them.
And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines, because so little of the world’s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor.
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected.
The good news is that there are now opportunities for change, most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs.
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today.
One is that they are very costly; or, more accurately, the price charged for them is very high, though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount.
Second, drug development is geared toward maximizing profit, not social benefit, which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare.
Because the poor have so little money to spend, drug companies, under current arrangements, have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development.
But, in the United States, it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development – directly, through public support (National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation), and indirectly, through public purchases of medicine, both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market; most individuals’ purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance.
Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good.
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness.
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available.
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first.
On the contrary, everything becomes brighter.
Yet, in America and most of the world, drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited.
That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create, which encourages them to hoard their knowledge, lest they help a competitor.
While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable, it allows drug companies to drive up prices, and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns.
In the health-care sector, it may be more profitable to devote research to a “me-too” drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference.
The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation, because, while the most important input into any research is prior ideas, the patent system encourages secrecy.
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund.
With a prize system, innovators are rewarded for new knowledge, but they do not retain a monopoly on its use.
That way, the power of competitive markets can ensure that, once a drug is developed, it is made available at the lowest possible price – not at an inflated monopoly price.
Fortunately, some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach.
The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research, which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing.
But, globally, our innovation system needs much bigger changes.
The WHO’s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial.
This spring, the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill, but on a global level.
Importantly, the report, “Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries,” recommends a comprehensive approach, including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries’ health needs; international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation; and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest.
In late May, the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly – a moment of hope for public health around the world.
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics.
It is, in many cases, a matter of life and death.
It is therefore essential to de-link R&amp;D incentives from drug prices, and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge.
For America, the Sanders bill marks important progress.
For the world, the WHO’s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care, and, more broadly, to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization.
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by.
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold
CAMBRIDGE – With youth unemployment touching 50% in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable?
If so, does enlarging the euro’s membership really serve Europe’s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that, at least for large countries, currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders.
At a minimum, currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone.
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell’s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap?
In his provocative American Economic Review paper “A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas,” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were, the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment.
He credited another (future) Nobel Prize winner, James Meade, for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work, but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently, especially in the context of Europe’s nascent integration.
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises, but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever.
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone’s crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region.
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States.
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain.
Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell’s ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany’s unemployment rate is below 7%.
Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960’s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber, a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk.
For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions.
In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country.
Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.
Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk sharing can, in theory, be achieved through financial markets.
This claim was hugely misguided.
Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy.
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness.
But, in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short term can stretch out for a very long time.
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube, much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century.
Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification.
Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant.
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks, but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities.
A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld, and even of Mundell’s labor-mobility criterion, is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy, most likely involving region-wide popular elections.
Europe’s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework.
European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine.
Perhaps they are right.
But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, including big ones.
Europe may never be an “optimum” currency area by any standard.
But, without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade.
The Global Economy’s New Path
WASHINGTON, DC – Whether we like it or not, the world around us is in a state of constant change.
But recent economic trends suggest that this change may be shifting its direction in a fundamental way.
Consider the advanced economies.
During the last two decades, economic growth in these countries was led by consumption – so much so that economic activity in these economies swung from investment to consumption by a total of 10 percentage points of GDP.
As a result, in 2010 the share of consumption in their GDP had reached 81.6%.

Meanwhile, emerging markets and developing economies provided almost a mirror image of this trend, raising their investment and boosting the supply of goods to the rest of the world at the cost of consumption in their own economies.
By 2010, the share of consumption in their GDP had declined, from 73.4% to 67.1%.
Looking forward, it is unlikely that the consumption share of GDP can increase further in advanced economies.
The main drivers of this increase were primarily financial engineering and wealth effects from strong asset prices.
Neither of these factors currently is at play to push consumption’s share of GDP higher.
But can the advanced economies’ consumption even be sustained at the current level?
Perhaps not.
Current levels of consumption are associated with over-extended governments and households, whose debt levels remain high, implying that more savings are required.
Banks also need to raise capital.
In general, many economic agents need an extended period of deleveraging.
However, current policies in the major advanced economies are aimed at maintaining current consumption levels in order to support growth and employment.
If the consumption share of GDP nonetheless declines, simple arithmetic tells us that investment and exports need to be higher to maintain total demand.
Should we expect emerging markets and developing economies to pick up the slack?
To sustain strong growth in these economies as external demand weakens, domestic demand needs to become the major engine of growth.
This means stronger domestic consumption and appropriate levels of investment to support such consumption growth.
In economies where investment levels are leading to excess capacity, resources could shift from investment to consumption, provided that these countries’ external accounts remain sustainable.
These are major tectonic shifts in the structure of the global economy, and are fraught with potential dangers.
The pace of change will vary between sectors and across economies, leading to mismatches of demand and supply worldwide.
Moreover, with globalization, an economic problem in one part of the world can be transmitted to the rest of the world more strongly, substantially complicating policy responses in both advanced and developing economies.
A study of such spillover effects by the International Monetary Fund suggests that, before the global financial crisis, external factors explained 36% of change in output in the five systemically important economies (the eurozone, the United States, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom); after the crisis, however, this share reached close to 60%.
In the rest of the world, including emerging markets, the share of external factors in output change increased from about 43% to more than 60%.
In this environment, we must diligently pursue policy coordination at the global level.
To achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide, policies that boost investment in one part of the world should match policies that boost consumption in other parts.
In particular, advanced economies should implement fundamental productivity-enhancing reforms, the eurozone should strengthen the currency union, and emerging market and developing economies should boost their domestic sources of growth.
And these policies should be consistent with fiscal and external stability.
Moreover, financial-sector policies and regulatory frameworks should be coordinated at the global level, in order to design and implement consensus-based rules – thereby addressing the problems posed by very large, global institutions that are considered too big or too complex to fail.
Only with such global coordination can we reduce, and possibly eliminate, economic instability and disorderly adjustments both at home and abroad, even as we seek to maximize the benefits of the inevitable changes in the global economy.
A Chinese Champion of Peace and Freedom
PRAGUE – On Christmas Day last year, one of China’s best-known human rights activists, the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo, was condemned to 11 years in prison.
Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08, a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77, calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution, and demanding the open election of public officials, freedom of religion and expression, and the abolition of “subversion” laws.
For his bravery and clarity of thought about China’s future, Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.
There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });First and foremost, he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights.
Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years.
We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless.
These ideals – respect for human rights and human dignity, and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights – represent humanity’s highest aspirations.
Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu’s courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals, it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu’s 11-year sentence. It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting.
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel’s original intent for the award.
In working to promote human rights, political reform, and democratization in China, Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago.
Of course, democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage. But it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state’s foreign and domestic policies.
This active and searching conversation, the hallmark of a democratic polity, is the best hope for better decisions by governments, both at home and abroad.
Liu’s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is, above all, intended for the benefit of the Chinese people.
But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China’s participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups, an independent media, and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box.
It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.
In conferring on Liu one of the world’s highest honors, the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand, and world peace and international solidarity on the other.
Liu’s harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure, a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path.
We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement, such as Liu’s, requires an exemplary response.
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves.
A Clarion Call for Emerging Markets
ITHACA – With 2012 underway, it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year’s resounding political transformations.
From the dramatic events in the Middle East, to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India, leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything.
They ignore this message at their peril.
Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000’s, and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse.
But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum.
Corruption takes many forms, but, in emerging markets, a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes.
Relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries; indeed, it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival.
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects.
In India, for example, the government lost as much as $30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction.
For ordinary people, large-scale corruption is less visible, because, while the sums involved are mind-boggling, the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft.
But the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality.
In countries like China and India, rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty.
But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared – the rich become super-rich, even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute.
Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets, but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains.
In many emerging markets, a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix.
The combination of corruption, inequality, and political repression builds up enormous pressure, and there are no institutional channels through which to release it.
But freer political regimes are not a panacea.
In a democracy like India’s, the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth, thus increasing the resentment of those left behind.
The opportunity to “throw the rascals out” in each election cycle helps to let off some steam, but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it.
It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest, but economic factors are key.
For example, rising food prices tend to hurt the poor, especially the urban poor, who spend a large share of their income on food; unlike agricultural workers, they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices.
With swelling urban populations, it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures.
Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression, information blackouts, or a combination of authoritarian measures.
China, for example, blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests.
The Arab Spring, however, reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows.
The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability.
Even with rapid increases in national income, if these countries’ leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly, they will become vulnerable to popular discontent.
Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability.
These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps, and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being.
Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment, strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable, and improving educational access and quality.
These lessons apply equally to advanced economies, which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption.
But, for those wealthy economies, restoring decent growth is now the major priority.
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption.
As the past year’s events have shown, the costs of inaction could be calamitous.
A Clockwork Chemistry
OXFORD – In Anthony Burgess’s novella (and Stanley Kubrick’s film) A Clockwork Orange, Alex, an unrepentant psychopath, has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images.
Like Pavlov’s dog, Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex.
This scene remains shocking, but, like most science fiction, it has aged.
The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired, and the fear that science will be used to make, or even force, people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned.
Science fiction ages fast, but it has a long afterlife.
Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists, and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural “clockwork” that underlies human morality.
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism, and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions.
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it.
Indeed, scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity.
A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios.
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others.
Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray, it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups, but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders.
Neuroscientists have even magnetically “zapped” carefully targeted areas of people’s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example, making it easier for them to lie.
Of course, no one is developing a “moral pill” that will transform us into saints.
But the research is advancing fast, and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions, sentiments, and motivations.
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better?
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to watch.
But as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil, and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as, and perhaps even worse than, the sadism of psychopaths like Alex.
I suspect that many will agree with this view. They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard, not a broken clock that scientists should fix.
Of course, most of us don’t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture.
But this does not mean that we are morally good, or good enough.
As you read this, perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others.
Even in the most advanced and affluent societies, a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency: think of locks, security alarms, police, courts, and prisons.
And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others, or give enough to the less fortunate.
Humans are born with the capacity to be moral, but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world.
For thousands of years, humans have relied on education, persuasion, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to make people behave decently.
We could all be morally better, but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further.
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics, or better arguments.
So we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance, by helping us design more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more persuasive ethical arguments.
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains.
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.
It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to promote morality through brutal coercion.
Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens’ moral code – we know that if they had such power, they would misuse it.
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves, whether by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy, or, yes, by taking a ’morality’ pill.
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better. It is not clear that people really want to be morally better.
And those who, like the psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably those who would want it least.
These are, of course, hypothetical questions.
We don’t yet know what is possible.
But it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late.
And even if “moral pills” are just science fiction, they raise deep questions.
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we won’t?
A Cloud over Airplane Safety
PRINCETON – When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano, it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped, but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed.
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban, or was it a reflection of the hardship, both personal and economic, that the ban was causing?
Over six days, about 95,000 flights were canceled, at a cost to airlines of more than $1 billion.
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed.
The British economy lost £1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected.
Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada.
In the past, jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power, and in one case, dropped thousands of feet, although all managed to land safely.
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems.
The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft, and that no matter how slight that risk might be, the government’s job was, as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it, “to make sure that safety was paramount.”
Indeed, in closing their skies, European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else.
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas.
Some 3,000 people die on the world’s roads every day.
Cutting speed limits to, say, 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives.
We don’t do it, because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving.
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite.
It is distasteful to put a price on human life, but the more we spend on safety, the less we will have for our other goals.
The British government uses a figure of a little more than £1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example, by improving road safety.
In the US, the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $5.8 million – nearly four times as much, at current exchange rates – for the same purpose.
Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US, but not in Britain?
Giovanni Bisignani, the head of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group, criticized the shutdown, saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken.
On the whole, though, the public seemed to support the decision.
Stranded travelers, interviewed at airports, typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky.
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk, or just a more urgent need to travel, than others?
John Stuart Mill, in his classic book On Liberty, considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe.
In Mill’s view, we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger.
Once he knows of it, the decision is his to make, because only he can judge the importance of his journey, and balance that against the risk he is running.
Air safety is slightly different, because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew.
If they are fully informed of the risks, and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money, as workers in dangerous occupations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly?
In the end, after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage, and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere, Europe’s skies were reopened.
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly.
Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety, we know that this is not only a technical question.
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question: how safe should we aim to be?
A Communist Party without Communism
PRINCETON – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia’s leaders have not changed a whit.
It looks increasingly likely that, as under Leonid Brezhnev, we will see the same names in the news for decades to come.
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies.
Indeed, it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics.
In the spirit of Schmitt, Putin’s men designated a liberal party, the Union of Right Forces, as their ur-enemy. Its public meetings were broken up by armed police; its leaders arrested and beaten; Putin called its supporters “coyotes.”
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger.
Oil prices are soaring, as are Putin’s approval ratings.
His appointees control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee.
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies, the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents, and the massive “social investments” of recent years, which, under Medvedev’s personal supervision, have bribed the population, no credible force can seriously challenge Putin’s men.
Yet their regime is in crisis, and they know it.
Russia’s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Military reform has been reversed.
Despite increasing incomes, Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power; they still die at a shockingly young age.
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption.
State monopolies undo what private businesses created.
With more money, ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats; as a result, the regime fails to rule the country.
The country is unruly, and its rulers know it.
So they panic.
Putin’s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia’s security forces.
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it “directed and controlled,” including the KGB.
Under Putin, the security service has had its revenge.
Its people have become powerful, arrogant, and enormously rich. They have also become disobedient.
In 2004, General Viktor Cherkesov, then Putin’s representative in northwest Russia, published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country.
This essay, more than anything else, defined Putin’s second term.
In October 2007, Cherkesov (now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services, the Federal Anti-Drug Administration) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues’ degradation: warriors had turned into traders, he complained.
Earlier, generals from a competing service, the FSB, had arrested Cherkesov’s deputy for “illegal bugging.”
In a public gesture of despair, Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin’s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services.
Cherkesov’s deputy remains in prison.
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense.
In the absence of Communist Party control, these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading, applying force when a trade did not go well.
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin’s circle also confronts this situation.
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another?
Cherkesov’s case exemplifies Putin’s nightmare.
But if your instincts betray you, you go back to even deeper ones.
Now that Putin’s people have left their predecessors’ neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique, the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services, the administration, business, and much else.
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction.
Preaching nationalism, its managers will believe in their universal competence, as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism.
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree.
Putin’s lawyers will reverse that decision; the party will have cells or committees in every factory, corporation, military unit, university department, etc. Integrated by the leader’s charisma and party discipline, party members will direct and unify the desolated country.
This is Putin’s plan.
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin will become the party’s general secretary.
As in the Soviet era, state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin.
And, of course, being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit.
In the end, Putin has what history left him: not ideas, just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power.
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality; Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party.
It is a bizarre ideology.
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, it shuns its Marxist origins.
It will subordinate all who really do work – traders, warriors, journalists, and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies.
A Confederation for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo.
If a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December, the province’s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally – a move that the United States has announced it may support.
That would be a disastrous step.
Russia would be furious, because it fears that Kosovo’s secession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.
Serbia is even more strongly opposed.
Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia’s state secretary for Kosovo, has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty.
Even if the government hesitates, ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops: the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin (only 40 “military observers” and 2,116 policemen) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });After eight years of international administration, Kosovo’s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence.
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.
Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as “Great Serbia” has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro.
Serbia is prepared to concede only “enhanced autonomy” to Kosovo, and some capacity to enter into international agreements.
Yet, while the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late for compromise.
But this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.
By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene.
It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals (for example, admission and circulation of foreigners, or extradition), plus the right to seek admission to the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence).
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.
However, a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues (for example, alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defence, borders (in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo’s Serbian minority.
As a result, Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects, bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body.
Of course, this confederation would be asymmetrical, because the Serbian government’s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited, whereas the Kosovar government’s “sovereignty” over Kosovo would be restrained.
To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions, the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates, two Kosovar delegates, and three representatives of the EU, thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates.
In addition, the EU should create a small but effective military force (say, 5,000 troops) to back up the common body’s decisions.
As with any compromise, the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement.
Serbia would save face, and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serbian minority.
Kosovo would acquire limited independence, with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN.
The EU would benefit as well, by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area.
Subsequently, the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent.
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.
Historically, confederations sooner or later either become federations (as occurred in the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or, pushed by centrifugal forces, split up (as with the United Arab Republic, established in 1958, which split three years later into Egypt and Syria).
The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage (lasting five or ten years), at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent.
Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo’s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing “sovereign authority” with other independent states, which could deflate Kosovars’ dangerously robust nationalistic demands.
A Conspiracy So Immense
NEW YORK – Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory?
Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation, documentation, and inference that takes shape – usually on the Internet – and spreads virally around the globe.
In the process, conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse, where they were generally consigned in the past, and sometimes into the very heart of politics.
I learned this by accident.
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I found myself, in researching new developments, stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation.
There are some major themes.
A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting – via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations, among others – to establish a “One World Government” dominated by themselves rather than national governments.
Sometimes, more folkloric details come into play, broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Rhodes Scholars, or, as always, the Jews.
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis.
In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims.
Historically, there tends to be the same set of themes: fearsome, uncontrolled transformative change led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans.
Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks – rapid urbanization, disruption of traditional family and social ties, loosening of sexual restrictions, and economic collapse – primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering.
Similarly, the “9/11 Truth Movement” asserts that al-Qaeda’s attack on the Twin Towers was an “inside job.”
In the Muslim world, there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks, and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day.
Usually, conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking.
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays?
Today’s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.
A clearly designated “enemy” with an unmistakable “plan” is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings – or failures – of unfettered capitalism.
And, while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational, the questions they address are often healthy, even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong.
In seeking answers, these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities.
Many citizens believe, rightly, that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses.
Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding, and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut.
Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust, setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum.
Likewise, in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping – if not drafting – public policies, many people believe, again rightly, that their elected officials no longer represent them. Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces.
Finally, even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because, in the last eight years, we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies.
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war, using fabricated evidence to do so.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque?
When even the 9/11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions (because they were based on evidence derived from torture), is it surprising that many want a second investigation?
Frequently enough, it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse – pursuing such theories – who report on news that the mainstream media ignores.
For example, it took a “conspiracy theorist,” Alex Jones, to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens. The New Yorker confirmed the story much later – without crediting the original source.
The mainstream media’s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias.
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow.
So even good, critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists.
The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview, and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions.
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia.
In a fevered environment, without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing, citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues, as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin’s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists.
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age.
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information, pitch stories, and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters.
They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting, unmediated by corporate pressures.
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism: finding good data, confirming stories with two independent sources, using quotes responsibly, and eschewing anonymity – that is, standing by their own bylines, as conventional reporters do.
This is how citizens can be taken – and take themselves – seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation.
In a time of official lies, healthy investigative energy should shed light, not just generate heat.
A Constitutional Coup in Ukraine
Changing constitutions is always a risky business.
But it is a downright dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone.
Indeed, when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office, you can be certain that he is up to no good.
That is exactly what is going on in Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted.
Kuchma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones.
No, Kuchma wants to change Ukraine's constitution for no other reason than to maintain his grip on power.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Today, Kuchma rules as an all-powerful president.
But his term ends next year and he cannot run again.
So, instead of retiring gracefully, as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do, Kuchma wants to change the constitution in order to become an all-powerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term.
Of course, constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten.
Constitutions can, and should, accommodate reform when necessary.
A powerful president, however, is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine. In our wrenching postcommunist transition, it is essential that a government can act decisively.
To change a system that seems best suited to Ukraine's circumstances, you need a good reason.
The Ukraine president is authorized to appoint and sack the prime minister, dissolve parliament if he wishes, and rule by decree if he judges that the country's institutions are in danger.
He maintains day-to-day control over every aspect of government.
Sopuissant a Caesar must be above reproach.
Kuchma is not.
On the contrary, what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution, but its president, who is mired in charges of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists, and who is shunned by other world leaders.
As president, Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular.
Even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall.
So Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on handpicking his successor, as Yeltsin did in Russia.
Unable to assure himself of a tame presidential successor, Kuchma wants what he calls a "parliamentary republic" with a weak president and powerful prime minister.
But the parliament he has in mind is a mutant, one where the authoritarian rule of the criminal clans Kuchma controls will continue, unabated, behind the facade of parliamentary procedure.
People too easily forget Ukraine, this big country on the border of the soon-to-be enlarged European Union.
But any attempt to prolong Kuchma's rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans of the early 1990's into outright dictatorship and chaos.
Indeed, this scenario could worsen, because Russia is unlikely to sit around idly and watch Ukraine unravel.
Intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances.
Only an imperial Russia, however, would dare reabsorb Ukraine.
But an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia. So Kuchma endangers freedom and human rights not only in Ukraine, but ultimately threatens Russia's democracy as well.
Luckily, there has never been a better time for the West--particularly the EU--to nudge Ukraine back from the brink.
With EU expansion coming next spring, all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union's easternmost border in Poland.
Although the job of maintaining Ukraine's democracy is primarily one for Ukrainians, the EU can help if it takes practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they won't be cut off from the rest of Europe.
A generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine that will benefit impoverished eastern Poland, are two possible inducements.
But these should be made conditional on Kuchma leaving the country's constitution and democracy alone.
The EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraine's domestic affairs.
After all, it hesitated little a few years ago to put a current member state, Austria, on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that country's democracy.
The wayward Kuchma is far more deserving of Europe imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior.
Similarly, the US should cast a wary eye at Kuchma's decision to send troops to Iraq.
It cannot be the case that America's fidelity to democracy in Ukraine can be so cynically purchased.
Within Ukraine, a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries poised to join the Union have done, thus helping to clean up the murky system in which Kuchma's criminal cronies flourish.
The constitution must be reformed, but not to shift power from one unaccountable leader to another.
What is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule, and transparency in decision-making.
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power, no matter what.
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election (or any other kind of election) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule.
It is, after all, President Kuchma who is discredited, not Ukraine's constitutional arrangements.
A Contagion of Bad Ideas
NEW YORK – The Great Recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession: it is mainly Europe and the United States, not the major emerging markets, that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment.
And it is Europe and America that are marching, alone and together, to the denouement of a grand debacle.
A busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession, but that also fueled substantial budget deficits.
The response – massive spending cuts – ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment (a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering) will continue, possibly for years.
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members.
It had no choice: with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the euro’s very survival was in growing jeopardy.
Europe’s leaders recognized that distressed countries’ debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow, and that growth could not be achieved without assistance.
But, even as Europe’s leaders promised that help was on the way, they doubled down on the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending.
The resulting austerity will hinder Europe’s growth, and thus that of its most distressed economies: after all, nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners.
And low growth will hurt tax revenues, undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation.
The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals.
The European Central Bank’s vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies – the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities’ debt – is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system.
The ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece’s bad sovereign debt, for fear that any private-sector involvement (PSI) would trigger a “credit event,” which would force large payouts on credit-default swaps (CDSs), possibly fueling further financial turmoil.
But, if that is a real fear for the ECB – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital.
Likewise, the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market, where they are held hostage to ratings agencies’ decisions about what constitutes a “credit event.”
Indeed, one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies.
Indeed, the most curious aspect of the ECB’s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event.
The whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable.
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring, surely they were safer after the restructuring, and thus equally acceptable.
This episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions, with a political agenda, and that independent central banks tend to be captured (at least “cognitively”) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate.
And matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic.
There, the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government, confirming what game theory suggests: when those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don’t get their way confront rational individuals, the former prevail.
As a result, President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy, with no tax increases – not even for the millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades, and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies, which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation.
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America’s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited – roughly $25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year.
But the payroll-tax cut (which put more than $100 billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans) was not renewed, and surely business, anticipating the contractionary effects down the line, will be even more reluctant to lend.
The end of the stimulus itself is contractionary.
And, with housing prices continuing to fall, GDP growth faltering, and unemployment remaining stubbornly high (one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one), more stimulus, not austerity, is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well.
The single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues, owing to poor economic performance; the single best remedy would be to put America back to work.
The recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction.
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America.
After all, America’s financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe’s problems, and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US – especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs.
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion: bad ideas move easily across borders, and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other.
The same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring.
A Cool Calculus of Global Warming
The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming, and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences.
Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank, the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming, but whether we can afford not to.
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater.
The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Indeed, the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs: for instance, climate change may lead to more weather variability, a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream – of particular concern to Europe – and a flourishing of disease.
When I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution, that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases, and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels.
But few saw, for instance, the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case.
Still, some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be, we should do little or nothing.
To me, uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today, not less.
As one scientist friend puts it: if you are driving on a mountain road, approaching a cliff, in a car whose brakes may fail, and a fog bank rolls in, should you drive more or less cautiously?
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large.
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend.
As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable.
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century.
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.
To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause.
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions.
The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm, but no war could be more devastating.
A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate.
This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution (carbon) tax for some current taxes.
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, like pollution, than things that are good, like savings and work.
Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets, in this case he has called for voluntary action.
But it makes far more sense to use the force of markets – the power of incentives – than to rely on goodwill, especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits, regardless of the cost to others.
Exxon has reportedly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming, just as the tobacco industry funded “research” to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer.
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol, and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries.
Most importantly, price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation.
Small changes in practices, when replicated by hundreds of millions of people, can make an enormous difference.
For example, simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning.
We have but one planet, and should treasure it.
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore.
A Cool Head for the Hottest Issues
LONDON – Reading Barack Obama’sDreams from My Father, the US president’s beautifully written reflections on his early life and identity, most people are struck by his cool and intellectual approach.
This is not to say that he is unemotional.
Obama can rage and weep.
But he rarely seems to act on the basis of raw sentiment or instinctive prejudice.
Pragmatic and highly intelligent, sooner or later every issue receives the full attention of his forensic curiosity.
Recalling Hillary Clinton’s famous Democratic primary television advertisement, Obama, it turns out, is exactly the sort of president that most of us would want to have in the post for that 3 a.m. phone call about an international crisis.
He would not be afraid to act, but he would be prepared to think first.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });I do not think, therefore, that Obama will be too vexed by some of the criticism he faces at the end of his first year in office, though he will undoubtedly grimace at the defeat of the Democratic candidate in the special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy’s old seat.
Obama was praised extravagantly a year ago; 12 months on, the criticism is over the top, too.
Obama inherited a terrible legacy – recession, financial meltdown, Iraq, Afghanistan.
He has not solved all of these problems.
But it is difficult to see any really bad mistakes, except perhaps allowing himself to be pushed around by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and giving China the impression that he was prepared for a bilateral relationship entirely on China’s terms.
That seems to be changing now.
Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world’s only superpower, you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected.
The left in America criticizes Obama for not turning the economy around already.
The right angrily denounces him as a crypto-communist because he wants every American to have health care.
With a dispassionate eye on the long game, what will the president himself be thinking?
One issue that Obama is certain to have in his sights is a problem that shadowed the world for years.
When I was growing up in the 1950’s and 1960’s, world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union.
The main strategic assessment on both sides of the Berlin Wall was that if either side made a wrong move, all of us might end up consumed in the flames of a nuclear holocaust.
This was called, in the geostrategic jargon of the day, “mutually assured destruction,” or MAD.
The acronym was entirely appropriate.
We have forgotten those days.
Yet there are still 23,000 nuclear warheads on our planet, with the explosive power of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs.
Terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one.
In all, there are eight nuclear-weapon states – the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, Israel, India, and Pakistan.
North Korea may also have a few bombs. Iran is believed by many to be trying to develop one.
Other states, which have their own civil nuclear capacity, have the potential to develop a weapon.
The number of countries in this category is bound to increase as the number of nuclear power reactors doubles over the next 20 years.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has contained the number of nuclear states.
A conference is to be held in May to renew and review it.
Obama clearly recognizes that the NPT needs to be strengthened in order to prevent countries from turning their civil nuclear-power capacity into weapons.
But Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions, they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals.
This is principally an issue for the US and Russia, which possess 95% of the world’s nuclear weapons.
In addition, it would help if the US could take a strong lead by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
The nuclear issue is one of the biggest items on the Obama agenda.
How it is handled will help to define his presidency.
Even before the talking gets serious in May, there will be the question of Iran to sort out.
Iran says that it seeks no more than its own ability to produce nuclear power.
Disbelief grows with every revelation of secret Iranian facilities and plans, and with every refusal by Iran to negotiate safeguards that would allow for civil use while preventing weaponization.
The US, the European Union, and Russia have tried to engage Iran on this issue, so far without success.
China seems likely to block effective sanctions on Iran because of its close energy relationship with the country.
How China eventually handles this will profoundly affect its standing in the US and Europe.
These are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more.
If he gets them right, he can forget about his short-term critics.
Fortunately, he is smart enough to know this.
A Crisis in Full Flight
MUNICH – For a while, it looked as if the European Central Bank’s €1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe’s banking system had calmed global financial markets.
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again, closing in on about 6%.
Of course, this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable.
After all, interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10% in the decade before the euro was introduced.
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6%.
Nevertheless, the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden.
The main problem is Spain, where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy combined, and, as in Greece, is in the neighborhood of 100% of GDP (93% to be precise).
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain’s youth are unemployed, reflecting the country’s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period.
The current-account deficit remains at 3.5% of GDP, despite the recession-induced decline in imports, while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again.
Moreover, Spain’s debt with the ECB’s TARGET settlement system rose by €55 billion ($72 billion) between February and March, because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated.
Since July 2011, Spain’s TARGET debt has grown by €199 billion.
Capital is in full flight, more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010.
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year (2008) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press.
The picture is little better in Italy, where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2% of GDP to a 3%-of-GDP deficit over the last ten years.
The country’s TARGET debt grew by €76 billion from February to March, with the total since July 2011 reaching €276 billion.
Italy, too, is being drained of capital; in fact, the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB’s liquidity injection.
It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy, because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital.
The purpose of the ECB’s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market.
In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table.
Indeed, now the French are looking wobbly.
As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012, France’s TARGET debt increased by €95 billion.
France, too, has become uncompetitive, owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years.
According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, the country’s price level must drop by an estimated 20% vis-à-vis the euro average – that is, depreciate in real terms – if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone.
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15%, and Spain by roughly 20%.
While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30% and 35%, respectively, the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone.
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort, if at all, and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation.
For Greece and Portugal, staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze.
There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels – bailout funds, eurobonds, or the ECB – from the eurozone’s healthy core to the troubled South.
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree.
Already German, Dutch, and Finish savings amounting to €15,000, €17,000, and €21,000, respectively, per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB.
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup.
Above all, however, the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity, if not to Europe’s economic collapse, because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment.
Such systems cannot work, because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system’s main steering mechanism.
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe’s politicians have started down this slippery slope.
A Crisis of Trust
LONDON – Public trust in financial institutions, and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them, was an early casualty of the financial crisis.
That is hardly surprising, as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed.
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe.
But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all.
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, “Our distrust is very expensive.”
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago: “It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Indeed, much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained.
Even within Europe, there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are prepared to use more flexible contracts, which are also beneficial for growth and investment.
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that oversee them – has been damaged by the crisis, we should care a lot, and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust.
In fact, the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret.
In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous.
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC.
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets, whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks, which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government.
The market will prove one side right before too long.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Their financial trust index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
That fall in confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators.
Furthermore, the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior.
In other words, if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks.
So falling trust had real economic consequences.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply. This has been positive for the stock market.
There is also a little more confidence in the government’s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.
The latter point, which no doubt reflects the Obama administration’s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government’s ability to regulate.
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG.
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could, therefore, have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground.
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors. Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
Some people are very trusting of others, and of the firms and institutions with which they do business. Others are congenitally distrustful.
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals’ income.
A pan-European opinion survey, which has been carried out for many years, allows us to relate the two.
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal.
The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes.
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them?
It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average.
In other words, if you diverge markedly from society’s average level of trust, you are likely to lose out, either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange, or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused.
When anyone I don’t know says “trust me” – an irritating conversational tic – I usually close my wallet.
Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same.
Maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much.
A Cure for Fiscal Failure?
CAMBRIDGE – Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates?
Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people’s feelings about fiscal policy, declaring that “the whole government is a Ponzi scheme.”
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008.
Personally, I suspect Madoff’s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while.
Still, with many of the world’s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented old-age pension obligations, and a downshift in growth, one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is.
In a new paper, “A Decade of Debt,” Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States, including federal, state, and local debt, has now surpassed the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II.
Japan, of course, is in even worse shape, with government debt totaling more than 200% of GDP.
Though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves, Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs – and this on top of its depressing demographic trends.
Many other rich countries’ debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs, despite relative peace in much of the world.
There is a no easy way out.
For now, low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs, but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, whereas real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise far more quickly, even for rich countries.
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue, hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity.
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts.
In principle, an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts.
It is high time to consider novel approaches.
Of course, no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems.
And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises.
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs – including their pension schemes – more realistic.
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start.
A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
But, while these older institutions have proven enormously useful, they are typically quite constrained.
The CBO, for example, is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth, but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future “fixes” at face value, somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies.
To enhance credibility, a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence, often with central banks as a role model.
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Canada.
The remit of Sweden’s fiscal council is particularly broad, giving it a mandate not only to forecast, but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy.
In principle, an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis.
In the US, such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans, perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk.
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks, at least anytime soon.
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy.
And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional.
Still, the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity.
Of course, fiscal councils by themselves are not enough, no matter how well designed they are.
It will remain very tempting for each generation to say, “My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I, so who cares if they have to pay some debt?” Moreover, the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias, as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment.
To resist these powerful pressures, fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to promote accountability.
To be sure, Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right, and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.
But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits.
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape.
A Czech Moment
PRAGUE – As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union, I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain’s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as “a faraway country of which we know little.”
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld’s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between “new and old” Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude. 
The reality is that there is no such thing as “old and new” Europe, and there never was.
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old.
We Czechs are 100% European, and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe.
Indeed, our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union, like our freedom, is so comparatively new.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union.
On the contrary, events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed.
The primary, and most pressing, of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU.
Unfortunately, conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve.
The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread, because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe’s young people, who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few.
It will fall to the Union, once again, to help transform despair into hope.
We Czechs know something about this, as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990’s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness.
To contain today’s financial and economic crisis, Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point.
The very existence of our Union, and particularly of the euro, has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930’s – the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn. 
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check.
For now, EU governments’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals.
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate.
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times, its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro.
These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen.
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia.
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated. Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year, but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold.
Now those talks have resumed, but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically.
Russia’s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members.
The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia’s budget, and lack of investment in the country’s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted.
Until now, Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU, because two-thirds of Russia’s exports to the Union comprise natural resources, which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides.
Given the stark changes in economic conditions, however, it is now in Russia’s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business, for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal.
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia.
Indeed, many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia’s closest friend in the Union.
But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members, and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole.  Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia. 
Europe’s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism, important as that undoubtedly is, but its unity.
When the Georgia crisis erupted, Europe united around a single position on Russia’s withdrawal.
It is the Czech Republic’s task, and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own, to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward.
During the 1990’s, the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect.  It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms.
We, like all EU presidencies, will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate.
A Daughter of Dictatorship and Democracy
SEOUL – It is something of a cliché question in South Korea nowadays: Who would be the country’s next president if the election were held tomorrow, rather than in December 2012?
Numerous opinion polls show Park Geun-hye of the ruling Grand National Party (GNP) to be the leading candidate.
If elected, she would be South Korea’s first woman president, and, for her rivals, her dominant position in the race is an uncomfortable but unassailable fact.
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country’s leadership.
Her political style is both refreshing and relevant, because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership.
And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately, which she likely learned – along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue – from her father, former President Park Chung-hee.
Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right-wingers, the iron-fisted Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979, in the wake of the 1961 military coup, only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief.
His daughter is proud of his legacy, which marked the beginning of South Korea’s economic boom.
Indeed, as a pillar of export-oriented modernity, Park Chung-hee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in military-authoritarian states.
At home, he still ranks first in popularity among the country’s heads of state, kindling nostalgia like a popular old record – a corollary to people’s frustration and anger at the current government of President Lee Myung-bak.
Park, who lost her first bid for the GNP’s nomination to Lee in 2007, needs to ensure that no rupture with her erstwhile rival knocks her off the path to victory in 2012.
An astute politician, Park did not hesitate to campaign wholeheartedly for Lee the last time around – a move that, as part of long-term political strategy, made perfect sense.
To many South Koreans, the election is now Park’s to lose.
No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her.
If she wins, it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity, not her political heritage.
No one in South Korea’s conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them.
And, as an icon of the right, she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status.
Despite her charisma, Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron.
Indeed, she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher – a lady not for turning, in Thatcher’s famous phrase, and with clearly thought-through political principles animating her actions.
In any case, she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge ‘jul pu se,’ literally meaning ‘reduce-loosen-strengthen tax-cuts,’ deregulation, and law and order, not just to add another chapter to her father’s old book.
Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country’s troubled recent past.
Left-leaning pundits claim that the dictator’s daughter has the same autocratic vision as her father, though Park invariably prefers incremental change to radical measures, and cut her political teeth in the tough-minded politics of the GNP.
Others take a flagrantly sexist stance, arguing that a woman president would be a non-starter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security.
Although these criticisms don’t seem to bother the electorate very much, Park’s path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect.
She has been called the “Queen of Elections,” in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man.
But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Korea’s most serious problems, including high unemployment, worsening educational performance, and North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
Ms. Park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years, while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy.
She favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles.
Come presidential election-day in 2012, South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue.
Park’s success will depend, in the end, on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines.
Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori’s daughter, who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month, Park is likely to defy her family’s tragic history.
If she does, she will be Asia’s most powerful woman, perhaps the most powerful in the world, at the end of next year.
A Day for Planetary Justice
PRINCETON – What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor, by our heedless production of greenhouse gases, is one of the great moral wrongs of our age.
On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.
October 24 is 350 Day.
The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world’s leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming – denounced as “alarmist” when they were first made just a few years ago – have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative.
We are approaching a point of no return, at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet, no matter what we do.
The melting of arctic ice is one example.
Four hundred years ago, explorers sought the legendary “Northeast Passage” across the north of Europe and Russia to China.
They found the arctic ice impenetrable, and soon gave up their quest.
This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.
But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
They are themselves a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun’s rays.
An ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice.  In other words, our greenhouse gas emissions have, by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice, created a feedback loop that will generate more warming, and melt more ice, even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow.
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger.
In Siberia, vast quantities of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are locked up in what used to be called “permafrost” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen.
But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing, which releases more methane.
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is.
At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that, while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem, its greatest impact will probably be on Africa, which has few resources to cope with the challenge.
Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs.
The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid, but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated: far more than their fair share of our atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our waste gases.
Sri Lanka took a similar stance, using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008, environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person.
In fact, the world’s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit.
But, while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit, Sri Lankan emissions were, at 660 kilograms, well below it.
As Sri Lanka’s government pointed out, “That means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent.”
This situation is an injustice of vast proportions, reminiscent of – and arguably much worse than – the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century.
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December.
Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change, but what most of them regard as “strong action” will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm.
In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps.
On October 24, people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2.
There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.
Churches will ring bells 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle towns, and, in many places, 350 trees will be planted.
Atwww.350.org you can find out what is happening near you and join in, or put your own idea online.
But don’t just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact.
One day your grandchildren will ask you: what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time?
A Day of Liberation
When I was seven years old, in 1960, my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 May 1945, the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe.
We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day, 6 June 1944.
One evening, I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past.
I have forgotten the details of their conversation, but I can still hear my grandmother’s sigh of relief when she said “Thank God we lost that war!”
From a child’s perspective, it wasn’t self-evident that losing was a good thing.
But of course, my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation.
The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago, the clearer I have seen another, less obvious dimension in what she said: It is “we” who lost the war.
Collectively, the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called “Nazis” – Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans, and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In today’s Germany, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation – not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.
Compared to public opinion in 1960, that’s certainly an enormous progress.
But paradoxically, it may also contain an element of forgetfulness, because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat.
To use my grandmother’s parlance, it is not “us” who were the liberators, but “them”.
The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself.
This is what the term “politics of memory” is meant to indicate.
And this is why it doesn’t matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago (as World War II), 90 years (as in the case of the Armenian genocide) or even 600 years (such as the battle of Kosovo in 1389).
A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present, as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side, and Japan on the other.
A war of memories, in turn, may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future.
Former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims’ moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves.
Therefore, the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German “politics of memory” than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be.
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed “Dresden’s Holocaust of bombs.”
Fortunately, their propaganda campaign has been a failure.
Although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level, there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively.
On the left side of the German political spectrum, the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged.
However, it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result.
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.
Its slogan “Never again war!” is only half the truth – the other half is “Never again appeasement!” 8 May 1945 was not “zero hour,” as a popular saying in Germany goes.
It had an antecedent, that is, a lack of pre-emptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 1930’s.
There is yet another lesson to be learned.
Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively.
But for millions of Central and East Europeans, liberation was followed by Stalin’s oppressive regime.
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia, with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year, reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility.
The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact, concluded in August 1939, had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties.
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem.
When Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations, he should bear in mind Nazi Germany’s contribution to the Baltic tragedy.
On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget.
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned, history is bound to repeat itself.
All this is perfectly true.
But personally, I will also remember my grandmother’s sentence “Thank God we lost that war!”
Thank God – and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe’s liberty.
A De-Globalized World?
Cambridge – It may take a few months or a couple of years, but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today’s crisis.
The world economy, however, is unlikely to look the same.
Even with the worst of the crisis over, we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world, one in which international trade grows at a slower pace, there is less external finance, and rich countries’ appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished.
Will this spell doom for developing countries?
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Not necesarily.
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants.
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing.
Second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms.
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products. 
The first two models are at greater risk than the third.
But we should not lose sleep over them, because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable.
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group.
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today’s new realities.
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end.
Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while, but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy.
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction, but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth, based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services, such as housing and construction.
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts, for similar reasons.  Commodity prices tend to move in cycles.
When they are high, they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other, non-traditional tradables.
Moreover, commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions, leading to costly struggles for resource rents, which are rarely invested wisely.
So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady, long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy: promoting diversification into manufactured and other “modern” goods.
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products, these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities.
Their governments pursued not just good “fundamentals” (e.g., macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation), but also what might be called “productivist” policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies, and financial controls.
China exemplified this approach.
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods.
In recent years, China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the US – the counterpart of its undervalued currency.
But it wasn’t just China.
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses (or very small deficits).
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows, because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies.
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash.
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future.
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services.
In the past, this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits.
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries.
So, are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other?
Will developing countries’ need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world’s intolerance of trade imbalances?
There is in fact no inherent conflict, once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses, nor even the volume of their exports.
What matters is their output of modern industrial goods (and services), which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously.
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption – which is why it generates a trade surplus.
By encouraging industrial production directly, it is possible to have the upside without the downside.
There are many ways that this can be done, including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure.
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument.
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate (in real terms) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly.
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances.
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood.
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate.
Another is that external policy actors (for example, the World Trade Organization) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate.
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances.
A Decade of Hugo Chávez
SAN JOSE – We should have known that something was amiss when, during President Hugo Chávez’s inauguration on February 2, 1999, he swore on Venezuela’s 40-year-old Constitution by declaring it “moribund.”
Under “the moribund,” as the Constitution came to be known, Venezuela not only had eight peaceful presidential transitions, but also enjoyed the fruits of democratic pluralism and strong civil and political liberties.
Of course, during this period Venezuela produced as much corruption and political irresponsibility as it did barrels of oil.
Nonetheless, Venezuela fared far better than the average Latin American country.
It wasn’t Switzerland, but, by anyone’s measure, it was a genuine democracy.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Not anymore.
Elections are still held, but the legacy of Chávez’s decade in power consists, first and foremost, in the demolition of democratic institutions.
Elected in a landslide to clean up the political vices of the previous establishment, Chávez chose to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
The previous regime, including its system of checks and balances and its tradition of political tolerance, did disappear, but its vices – particularly graft and demagoguery – became worse than ever.
Pretty much like 10 years ago, Venezuela, once a destination for immigrants from around the world, remains under-developed.
More fundamentally, Chávez represents ideas that have long stifled Latin America’s political and economic growth. This includes the notion that social justice can be achieved only by abandoning the path of reform and rejecting “bourgeois” democratic forms in favor of “real” democracy, born of revolutionary purity and the leader’s millenarian dreams.
That’s simply false.
Though the Chávez revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality, it is hardly sustainable and reeks of patronage.
In fact, one can find similar achievements in Chile and Brazil, which have not given up on democratic checks and balances, political pluralism, or freedom of the press, and have not enjoyed the luxury of $300 billion in oil revenue in the space of one decade.
Moreover, it ought not to be forgotten that between 1950 and 1980, Venezuela itself reduced extreme poverty from 43% to 8% of the population, one of the lowest figures in Latin America.
It did so with democracy and freedom.
Chávez also repeats,ad nauseam, the idea that others are to blame for Latin America’s ills.
This is the pernicious victimization narrative – still very popular in universities across Latin America – the late Venezuelan journalist Carlos Rangel eloquently refuted in books such asThe Third World Ideology.
It is obvious that Yankee imperialism cannot be blamed for Venezuela’s emaciated tax system, dismally bad schools, rampant corruption, high crime rate, and feeble political institutions.
In all of these areas, Venezuela is faring poorly even by Latin America’s low standards. This is particularly true in the case of institutional weakness.
When Chávez declares “moribund” a legitimate constitution, or when he proclaimsl’état c’est moi by declaring a national holiday to commemorate his 10 years in power, we see eloquent examples of a homemade institutional farce that would doom any country to the ninth circle of misery.
None of these ideas would fly, of course, in a contented nation.
In this sense, Venezuela’s experience speaks to all of Latin America.
The combination of economic growth (now in reverse because of the global crisis) and atrocious levels of inequality and social segmentation will continue to breed the same unmet expectations and social resentment that cleared Chávez’s path to power.
As long as Latin America’s democracies fail to take seriously the tasks of reducing inequality, spreading opportunity, and nurturing more cohesive societies, they will continue to court disaster.
To avoid this outcome, it is vital to purge certain reactionary and numbing beliefs, including the idea that reducing poverty obviates the need to address inequality, or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems.
If the tenth anniversary of Chávez’s tenure can serve as a reminder of the perils that beset unjust democracies – especially now that a new electoral cycle in Latin America looms – then Venezuela’s agonizing recent history would, at least, be redeemed.
A Declaration of Independence from the US
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism, especially with the military response to terrorism. American foreign policy reflects that obsession.
This year, the US will spend around $450 billion for the military, including the costs of the Iraq War, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, global environmental degradation, and global diseases.
In other words, US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity, global public health, and a sustainable environment.
Throughout 2003, the world lived with Bush's obsession.
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, and took up almost the entire UN agenda.
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed.
At the same time, Bush's emphasis on a one-dimensional, militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to increased terrorism in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy.
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues, and emphasizing the military response to it, will not bring prosperity and peace, or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks.
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria.
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatments (anti-malarial medicines) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa's malaria in a year.
As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive, failing approach of America's government.
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, vulnerability to disease, and climate change.
Ironically, President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word.
He declared in London recently that "the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required."
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges.
For example, at the International Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, America signed the Monterrey Consensus, which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7% of national income.
That would bring an additional $60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year. Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled.
The US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992.
It has so far failed to act.
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
Yet at Cancun, Mexico earlier this summer, it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies.
The list goes on and on.
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty, yet it has taken few steps in that direction.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America committed itself to protect global ecosystems, yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then.
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN.
But because the US is the richest, most powerful country in the world, its neglect is devastating.
If the US really wants to undercut terrorism, it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere.
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses.
The US represents just 5% of the world's population, and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly.
Poor countries, especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, the Philippines--should say, "We need to act on the issues that concern us, not just on the issues that concern the US."
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness.
A Democratic Windfall for Turkey?
Turkey's seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey's conflict between its "strategic alliance" with America and its drive to join the EU.
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU.
Some liberal elements of that "secular" coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });After coming to power, the AKP's leaders, former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as "conservative democrats," energetically engaged with the US, the EU, and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq, from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey.
Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey's "secular" state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board, the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West.
The US, preoccupied with the supposed specter of a "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the West, saw the AKP's modern, westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey.
Today, both "conservative democrats" and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU, while opponents include extreme nationalists, of both left and right, as well as some elements of the "secular" establishment.
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December's summit of EU leaders.
Instead, the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again, putting off formal negotiations that, in any case, may take years to complete.
Europe's persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary.
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkey--a longstanding NATO member and close American ally--while Europeans complain about the Turkish military's domestic political role.
The paradox is that, by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey's options, Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey's status as a military outpost of the US.
At least, that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq. Then, despite massive US pressure, Turkey's parliament unexpectedly rejected the government's proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory.
Turkey's refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war.
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis, an effort no current EU member could have contemplated.
Parliament's rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate.
Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government's true "Islamic" character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party--founded by Atatürk and still fully "secularist"--voted against the plan.
Likewise, other elements of Turkey's secular establishment, including the President and the military leadership, either opposed or were lukewarm, at best, to the idea of war in Iraq.
Turkey's military initially remained silent on the issue, uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold.
By contrast, the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus.
Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives: either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state, or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship.
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament, which, in voting down the US plan, reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war.
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops.
In fact, the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US, consult with the Turkish military and President, and share all information with the public and parliament.
Walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation, the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament.
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally.
After the US military action in Iraq, the tables may be turning in surprising ways.
As America establishes itself in Iraq, Turkey's geopolitical military significance may decline.
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey's symbolic importance as a role model.
This shift in Turkey's strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform.
With careful management, Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe, while rebuilding its relationship with America.
A Devaluation Option for Southern Europe
CAMBRIDGE – This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro.
The eurozone’s survival demands a credible solution to its long-running sovereign-debt crisis, which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances –&nbsp;external and fiscal –&nbsp;which are at the heart of that crisis.
The crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone.
From 1996 to 2010, unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8%, and by 13% in France.
Compare that to 24% in Portugal, 35% in Spain, 37% in Italy, and a whopping 59% in Greece.
The result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries, a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe (and France) – much of it owed to foreign creditors.
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone?
Suppose, for example, that Portugal were to leave and re-introduce the escudo.
The ensuing exchange-rate devaluation would immediately lower the price of Portugal’s exports, raise its import prices, stimulate the economy, and bring about much-needed growth.
But a euro exit would be a messy affair.
The resulting turmoil could very well trump any short-term gains in competitiveness from devaluation.
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe’s troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates.
It involves increasing the value-added tax while cutting payroll taxes.
Our recent research demonstrates that such a “fiscal devaluation” has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP, consumption, employment, and inflation.
A currency devaluation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper.
A VAT/payroll-tax swap would do exactly the same thing.
An increase in VAT raises the price of imported goods, as foreign firms face a higher tax.
To ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices, an increase in VAT needs to be accompanied by a cut in payroll taxes.
Moreover, since exports are exempt from VAT, the price of domestic exports will fall.
The desired competitiveness effects of exchange-rate devaluation can thus be had while staying in the euro.
This policy can also help on the fiscal front.
As is true of an exchange-rate devaluation, the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues.
Moreover, an important advantage of fiscal devaluations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country’s trade deficit.
For countries that are suffering from weak competitiveness and, as a consequence, running trade deficits, this typically means more revenues, especially in the short run.
Like exchange-rate devaluations, fiscal devaluations create winners and losers.
Both act as a wealth levy: inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss in proportion to their wealth and the size of the devaluation.
If taxes on capital are not adjusted, holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss.
By contrast, many transfers, such as unemployment benefits, health benefits, and public pensions, are indexed to inflation, and thus maintain their real value.
The same is true of minimum wages.
These distributive effects play an important role in the politics of exchange-rate devaluations, and most of these effects appear in fiscal devaluations as well.
Fiscal devaluations already have some advocates.
Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government just announced one.
And concerns that a fiscal devaluation will conflict with euro rules can be met by simply pointing out that Germany’s government carried one out in 2007, though by another name, when it raised VAT from 16% to 19% and cut employers’ contribution to social insurance, from 6.5% to 4.2%.
In short, there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate devaluation that can address southern Europe’s short-term competitiveness problems.
To be sure, feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in size.
But, together with debt restructuring, accommodative monetary policy, liquidity support from the European Central Bank, and much-required structural reforms, they can help to put these troubled economies on a sound footing without a euro breakup or a major austerity-induced recession.
A Doomsday Scenario
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq, fears that the country's economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion; with that, worries about the health of the global economy are growing, too.
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy's growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come.
Can the situation get worse? Yes, it can: much worse.
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time:
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan's misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor.
Today, these deficits set new records by the month;
America's appallingly low savings rate.
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed, this was understandable; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings, so why bother?
Today's savings rate, while it has increased slightly, still finds America at the bottom of the world's savings league tables;
lax accounting standards.
The Arthur Anderson, Enron, and WorldCom scandals didn't emerge out of thin air, but had their origins in the mid-1990s, when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters.
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today's excess capacity.
To this old brew, new ingredients have been added, notably the most rapid change in a nation's fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen.
In a "now you see it, now you don't" move only a magician should love, the $3 trillion, ten year (non social security) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gapingdeficit of $2 trillion dollars.
Of course, excuses are at hand: the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold.
Excuses, excuses.
As the old saying goes: Don't count your chickens before they hatch. The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens, it sold them forward!
To anyone with decent eyesight, it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense.
Clear, too, was the fact that, in promoting its tax cuts, the Bush Administration was engaging (on a multi-billion dollar scale) in dishonest, Enron-like accounting.
So if things are so bad now, how can they get worse?
Here's a plausible scenario.
To finance its trade deficit, America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day.
When America was the only safe haven for global investors, this was easy.
But America today appears less safe.
The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts, lack of confidence in America's economic policy management (compounded by the mounting deficits), and America's soft underlying economic fundamentals, has dented the US economy's global reputation.
As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect, the dollar will weaken.
As the dollar weakens, America looks even less safe. So a rush to the door begins.
While a weak dollar may be good for exports, a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence.
Eventually, even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement, especially given Bush's proposed risky experiments with the social security system.
At that point, Americans will join the stampede out of their economy.
Why shouldn't they?
They're free to choose where to put their money. Europe's stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative.
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe.
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports.
The European Central Bank, fixated on inflation, will be slow to lower interest rates, and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses.
Europe will join America in a downturn, reinforcing America's decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral.
I am not predicting that this will happen.
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy: a tax cut that might made minimal sense when itseemedthat the US had a multi-trillion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all.
The Bush Administration should admit this, and redesign a tax program to strengthen the economy by making the country live within its means.
President Bush could even stabilize the economy, offering better unemployment benefits to provide needed stimulus if the downturn continues.
America is strong, and the global economy is strong.
Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur, a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes.
Downturns, of course, can never be fully prevented.
We can, however, decrease their frequency; we can make them shallower; we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected.
Sadly, we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences.
A Drug War on Auto-Pilot
THE HAGUE – The war in Afghanistan, now approaching its tenth year, may seem to many to have no end in sight, but Latin America has endured an even longer fight, one that has recently become much more bloody: the “war” against drug trafficking.
So rote – and so violent – has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction.
The new strategy that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been promoting to staunch the upward trend of narco-trafficking-related murders – which leaked Mexican government reports put at more than 22,000 since late 2006 – is to build “stronger, more resilient communities.”
Ciudad Juárez, a sprawling Mexican border town that is now the homicide capital of the world, would have to be high on the list.
Four bridges and innumerable tunnels and drainage canals connect Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas.
Rival cartels sparring for control of a plaza, the name given to any trafficking route, butcher each other and the security forces.
There is apparently no shortage of young, unemployed men willing to join the carnage.
Addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems of a city like Juárez, however, is a lot harder than flooding its streets with 8,000 soldiers carrying assault rifles.
Mexican President Felipe Calderón has, in this respect, remained faithful to the script written in previous theaters in the drug war, whether in Bolivia, Colombia, or Peru, where governments have used military force and extradition to placate the US and punish those with the least voice and influence.
But the language used by the Obama administration to describe the violence and state corruption that snakes from the Andes to the US border is starting to capture new thinking on narcotics.
Three former Latin American presidents, Mexico’s second richest man, Ricardo Salinas, and the Supreme Court of Argentina, among others, have criticized the war on drugs as a manifest failure that has lowered street prices, fueled production, and undermined weak states.
More strikingly, both Bolivia and Ecuador are governed by presidents who suffered directly from the collateral insensitivities of the war on drugs.
Bolivia’s Evo Morales rose to prominence as leader of the country’s coca growers during a brutal campaign to wipe out their crops, the so-called Dignity Plan.
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa’s father was jailed for smuggling drugs to the US when the future leader was five years old.
These leaders’ profound ambivalence toward the goal of a world free of illegal drugs is shared by the European Union, where restrictions on narcotics consumption have slackened over the past decade.
The past three US presidents, furthermore, have all admitted to consuming – to one extent or another – illegal psychoactive substances, while seven million Americans, according to the United Nations, are regular cocaine users.
But the inertia of a bureaucratic drug-enforcement superstructure (worth approximately $40 billion each in the US and the EU), sustained by a deep-seated fear of the “threat” posed by drugs and cartels, appears to push policy repeatedly towards the familiar option of repressive auto-pilot.
For example, US support for Mexico’s campaign against the cartels looks set in stone, with Congress apparently ready to provide $300 million for another year of military and security upgrading.
In Colombia, seven new joint military installations are planned, and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted.
Nevertheless, as the flaws in the four-decade-old edifice of counter-narcotics become more visible, it is increasingly difficult to regard the risks of drug use as being greater than the damage done by repression.
Prohibition hikes the mark-up on prices – an astounding 15,000% in the case of cocaine traveling to Europe from Andean processing facilities.
While the war on drugs focuses on bringing down cartels and their kingpins, it perversely aids the health of their markets, which nestle within legitimate trade flows and respond to price incentives.
Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year, the second-in-command of the giant Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada, made the point clearly: “The narco problem involves millions of people.
How do you control it?
The capos can be jailed, killed, or extradited, but their replacements are already wandering around.”
The emergence of Latin America’s powerful drug mafias cannot be traced to the radical evil of certain individuals.
These people emerged under conditions created in deeply inequitable societies by a misapplied, inconsistent, and bureaucratic war.
Indeed, the furies of the Zetas in Mexico originate in the counter-insurgency training provided in the 1990’s to a select group of special-forces soldiers, who later deserted.
The Zetas’ star recruits in recent years have come from the Guatemalan military’s special forces, whose infamous induction technique involved biting off the head of a live chicken.
Meanwhile, in Jamaica and across the rural outposts of Central America, drug lords have become benefactors and heroes to the poor.
It is time for serious reconsideration of the status and regulation of illegal drugs, pointing to selective legalization, as well as reclassification of the market as a public-health, rather than a criminal, concern.
For now, policymakers across the Americas are tiptoeing towards the obvious.
A Dutch Treat for Brazil?
Brazil's successful return to the financial markets at the end of April and the strengthening of the country's currency, the real, have shown that the election of President Luiz Inácio da Silva (Lula) has not led to a collapse of foreign confidence.
But nor do recent positive developments eliminate the need for structural economic reforms.
Lula recognizes that progress in this area, including labor market reform, is critical if Brazil is to grow sufficiently to allow him to carry on his ambitious social agenda.
How Lula, a former metal worker and founder of CUT, which also represents most automobile workers, manages relations with the trade unions will be critical.
Recent strikes by car workers at General Motors, Renault, Volvo, and Ford factories in Brazil do not augur well.
Proposed social security and tax reforms, presented to Congress at the end of April, seem to be creating additional tension.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Lula should look to Europe for examples of how to achieve high rates of growth and job creation yet maintain social protection.
Europe also can provide a roadmap for politicians determined to move from being anti-market left-wingers in opposition to reform-minded statesmen holding power.
Spain's Felipe González and Britain's Tony Blair both made that journey.
But a better example may be Wim Kok, who stepped down last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister.
Both Lula and Kok share the unusual distinction of becoming heads of government after serving as trade union leaders.
Upon reaching the top of the FNV, Holland's largest trade union, Kok found himself in a position of considerable influence in Dutch economic policymaking.
During his tenure as a union leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Dutch economy experienced prolonged malaise--stagnant growth, high unemployment, prohibitive interest rates, and low corporate profitability.
Large fiscal deficits crowded out private investment.
Holland's problems were mainly structural, although a cyclical economic downturn made matters worse.
By 1982, the situation had deteriorated to the point that the "social partners" in the Dutch tripartite system (government, business, and trade unions) concluded that combating the crisis required a break with the past.
The defining moment came with the Wassenaar agreement of that year--a pact between employers and trade unions, reached with the active encouragement of government.
Trade unions agreed to moderate wage claims and abandon wage indexation, in exchange for reduced working time and improved prospects for the future.
The increased flexibility of the Dutch labor market eventually restored private-sector profitability and led to rapid job creation, among the highest in Europe and comparable to the rate in the US.
A prudent fiscal stance, pursued while the economy recovered and interest rates fell, created room for big cuts in taxes and social contributions.
With lower inflation, this raised workers' real disposable income, enabling trade union leaders to demonstrate to their members that wage moderation worked and was in their interest.
The recent, much weaker, performance of the Dutch economy is largely explained by strong wage increases, which undermined competitiveness and contributed to job extinction.
This prompted Kok to call last year--on the 20th anniversary of the Wassenaar accord--for a new pact among the country's social partners.
He will soon have a European-wide platform to deliver his message of wage moderation and labor-market flexibility through his assignment to breathe new life into the EU employment strategy.
How is the Wassenaar model relevant to Brazil?
Not unlike Holland in the early 1980s, Brazil's economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates.
While Brazil's registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards, its fast growing labor force requires a high rate of job creation.
Emulating the Dutch experience with job creation provides the surest possible path to alleviating poverty in Brazil.
The idea is not that Brazil should seek to implement the Dutch social-economic model--the countries are too different for that.
But Lula can and should follow Kok's example and use his trade union connections, as well as his rapport with the working class, to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in Brazil's overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become Latin America's economic powerhouse.
Brazil has benefited from an improvement in market sentiment and financial indicators since Lula's election.
Now its government should encourage a Wassenaar-style guarantee of social peace.
This would give the authorities room to address the country's daunting longer-term policy agenda--including a major reform of the costly pension system, an overhaul of the tax system, and strengthening the bankruptcy framework--that Brazil must face in order to boost competitiveness.
Lula's countrymen, who elected him overwhelmingly, need rapid economic growth and job creation.
That will happen only if Lula completes a successful transformation from anti-market trade union leader into a statesman judiciously blending economic and social reform.
Success would benefit not only Brazil, but have a strong demonstration effect across Latin America.
A Europe for All
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union’s future, but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration.
To join in the EU’s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy, for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end, but a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, all are not free.
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net, tied in a single garment of destiny.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.
Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, of haves and have-nots, of insiders and outsiders.
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot – indeed, must not – be considered a stranger to its Union.
Today’s great Pax Europa and today’s pan-European prosperity depend on this.
Of course, some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe.
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people, young and old, factory worker, farmer’s wife, the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms.
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930’s, who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970’s?
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland’s Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague’s Velvet Revolution in 1989?
That is the true European spirit, and no doubts can crush it.
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: Let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer.
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.Those who doubt Ukraine’s European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom, prosperity, and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe’s past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe’s peace and Europe’s unity.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status.
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany – a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests.
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia, and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe’s peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations, but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or fast.
But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done.
We know the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the struggle, and Europe should know that this is our goal.
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism – ideologies born in the heart of Europe – battled for mastery.
Only a few months ago, in cities throughout Ukraine, our children and our parents confronted armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about our old regime’s corruption, was brutalized and beheaded by that regime’s thugs.
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine’s people prevailed.
So, despite today’s doubts and difficulties, I retain an abiding faith in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine’s history.
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism’s legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity.
When the EU’s citizens ponder Ukraine’s place in Europe, they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see.
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted, beyond the poverty, and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule.
Instead, they should look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison during last year’s election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom “the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded.”
A Europe of Judges
MAYNOOTH, IRELAND – As the Greek financial drama reaches its sorry dénouement, another crisis looms for the European project – this time in Germany, beginning with a case now before Germany’s Constitutional Court.
Away from the rarefied atmosphere of EU summits (which, so far, have been shaping the Union’s response to events in Greece), other institutional actors have been – and are – shaping the EU system.
In particular, courts have driven European integration forward as much as politicians have.
The powerful European Court of Justice (ECJ), in particular, has frequently been criticized for using European law to disguise an integrationist agenda.
Without the ECJ’s doctrines of “direct effect” and “primacy,” and without national courts that are willing to enforce these doctrines in their own jurisdictions, the EU most likely would not have attained the level of integration that it has.
National courts may consider the effects of European integration on their constitutional and democratic institutions, affirming or rejecting the integration that has already taken place, or setting limits to supranational arrangements that might further impinge on national sovereignty.
This is significant, because, in May 2010, a group of prominent German economists, led by Joachim Starbatty, commenced litigation before the German Constitutional Court in which they argued that the EU’s assistance to Greece and Europe’s new financial rescue fund violated Article 125, the EU treaty’s so-called “no bailout” clause.
The Court will begin hearing the case on July 5.
Germany’s Constitutional Court has been among the most prominent in declaring what it considers to be the appropriate limits to EU integration, consistent with the country’s Basic Law (constitution).
In a number of landmark judgments, the Court has expressed skepticism about any move toward a federal EU.
In 1993, when ruling on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the judges expressed clear reservations about the direction of the European integration process.
Their main argument was that the shortcomings of EU-level democratic practices required the German Bundestag to retain a substantial number of policy competences.
For the same reason, the competence to decide upon the further allocation of competences had to remain a prerogative of the German state and could not be transferred to the EU.
Crucially, the Court also asserted its authority to invalidate European laws if found by the judges to lack a basis in the European treaties.
In another landmark ruling in June 2009, the Court made Germany’s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty conditional upon the passage of new legislation giving the Bundestag enhanced powers of scrutiny over European affairs.
The Court relied on the same constitutional doctrines and conceptions of sovereignty elaborated in its Maastricht judgment.
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU’s recently agreed European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is consistent with the Basic Law.
The risk that the judges could rule the ESM illegal played no small part in efforts made in recent months by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy to bind the EU to a revised and more intrusive economic governance framework, effected through an amendment to the existing treaties.
The debate on sovereignty in Germany and other EU member states has been re-ignited not just by the debt crisis, but also by a string of controversial rulings by the ECJ, most notably the Court’s interpretation of the freedoms of establishment and service delivery articulated in its Viking, Laval, and Ruffert decisions.
The discontent within Germany with the cumulative impact of these decisions has been expressed publicly by some of the country’s most trusted public representatives.
In September 2008, for example, former President Roman Herzog published a polemic entitled “Stop the ECJ!” He accused the Luxembourg judges of grabbing ever-greater competences at the expense of the member states and urged the Constitutional Court to invalidate several controversial ECJ rulings.
Herzog’s broadside resonated across Europe, where for some time there has been considerable disquiet about “judicial activism” and what some see as an irreversible trend toward empowerment of the ECJ and other EU institutions.
In many member states, the ECJ’s decisions have produced a backlash, especially on the left, with trade unions and social movements targeting the Court’s alleged zeal in siding with business over workers interests.
Such arguments were deployed successfully during the 2005 referenda on the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, and in Ireland during the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
Indeed, the threat to the EU legal order does not lie solely with the German Constitutional Court.
In Ireland, an embattled austerity-driven coalition government might well have no choice but to hold a referendum on the European Stability Mechanism.
It is almost certain that Euro-skeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ESM.
The Irish government has stated emphatically that any amendments to the Lisbon Treaty connected to eurozone reforms will not require a referendum.
Its reasoning seems to be that the proposed changes fall far short of what the Supreme Court’s case law demands, and that the ESM does not alter the EU’s essential scope or objectives.
If the Irish Supreme Court were to decide that the ESM requires popular consent, the EU would be faced with the prospect of yet another Irish referendum on Europe.
Thus, Ireland might yet play as significant a part as Germany in determining the future of any amendments to the EU constitutional order, with each country’s top court playing as important a role as politicians in shaping Europe’s future.
A Europe of Provinces, Not States
As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union's future institutions, now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading.
Or at least, to consider perhaps a quite different question: where would it be reasonable for the EU to move?
Communism's fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe.
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation.
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states.
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well.
Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence, and Yugoslavia's breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence, there is something tantalizing new in all this as well.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In the interwar years, the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical, artificial creations of the Great Powers.
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states.
Why was this?
Because 80 years ago, when Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe, small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace.
To be viable, a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market.
None of this holds true today.
With the prospect of entry into the EU, national markets matter less.
Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable, and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members.
Lacking such external threats, the ties between, say, Czechs and Slovaks (to say nothing of Serbs and Croats!) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government.
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole?
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years.
After all, wasn't Italy, until 1860s, a collection of kingdoms and principalities?
Wasn't Germany's unification a matter of ``blood and iron''?
France and Spain are older, but is the marriage of Basques, Catalans, and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech/Slovak marriage?
Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English?
Abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity, patriotism, the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today's linguistic communities and think of this: why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government, between the common European framework and their local institutions?
Why do Piemontese, Bavarians, or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies, welfare programs, securities laws, and the largely useless, duplicative armies?
Wouldn't life be easier if a common market, currency, foreign policy, army, and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis, with the rest left to more meaningful local units?
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation.
But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees, billions wasted in political patronage, and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40% of the economic product of Europe's nation states.
Could any common European state do worse?
Indeed, the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy (and society as a whole) in Europe's entire history.
Look at America in 1787: creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies, ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent.
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states.
It is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic.
If it were todisplace national governments, its burden would be weightless in comparison to what exists today.
Nations also put Europe's constitutional balance out of kilter.
Germany and Italy are simply too big, as compared to Portugal or Belgium (itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons), and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire.
Could a federal Europe replace today's national identities?
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in ``Europe'' as they feel in their national states?
No, but must they?
When Europeans think of future institutions, the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity.
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions?
What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions, but by adevolution of loyalties, and a revival of smaller, more meaningful, communities?
Of course, the demise of national states is not imminent, but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens.
Indeed, national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions, clichés, like race, class, and other ideological creations.
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle.
But Europe's nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they arecenters of power.
After all, forty cents out of every euro of GDP is a lot to fight about.
If, however, Europeans gain a sense of where they should be going, perhaps in time the national identities forged in the last couple of hundred years (for they are not much older than that) will become like the appendix - a part of the human body responsible for little else but an occasional inflammation.
A European Opening for the Arab World
BERLIN – The people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown that democracy in Arab countries need not come at the barrel of a Western gun.
But, while the drive for democratic change has been local and authentic, there is no guarantee of a successful political transition: democratically elected governments will have to address the same social and economic problems that contributed to the old regimes’ fall – not least the need to create jobs and opportunities for the young.
This will be impossible without external support. Given the myriad links between the European Union countries and the Mediterranean’s southern rim, Europe must not miss this opportunity.
So far, the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections, establish political parties, and reform the police, courts, and local administrations.
But such political-administrative support is not enough. Nor is a Marshall Plan-type program of grand investments sufficient.
This is not to discount the need for such projects; the renewable-energy sector, in particular, holds enormous opportunities for cooperation.
Europe needs clean energy, and will not be able to produce enough on its own territory.
The countries of North Africa also need energy – particularly more electricity and new networks to support urban and industrial development.
Indeed, the availability of uninterrupted electricity often makes the difference between, say, a shoemaker’s workshop and a shoe factory. And these countries have the most suitable environment for solar thermal power production.
According to some optimistic studies, solar thermal power plants and wind farms in North Africa could not only boost economic growth there, but also provide more than 15% of Europe’s electricity by 2050.
Obviously, cooperation agreements and private investment in this sector should be encouraged.
The problem is that such long-term investments bring results only in the medium and long term.
They do not address today’s social or economic problems, nor do they signal a new society-oriented approach by Europe towards its Mediterranean neighbors.
New EU programs should mainly aim at strengthening the specific capacities of Tunisia, Egypt, and others, and seek opportunities that benefit both sides of the Mediterranean.
Catherine Ashton, the EU’s vice-president and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, has proposed a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which contains a host of useful measures, including facilitation of visas for students, academics, and business people.
But, to make this scheme more concrete, I would suggest augmenting it with a “pact for labor and skills” between the EU and the Arab countries that choose a path to democratic transformation.
Europe, while afraid of illegal migration, needs foreign labor for its own demographic reasons – not least young engineers, technical staff, doctors, and health-care workers.
Tunisia, Egypt, and the other Southern Mediterranean countries have an abundance of young people with degrees and no jobs, who often also need to acquire practical skills.
This is most urgent for the Arab world’s baby boomers – those between 20 and 35.
The next generation is already smaller.
As a practical step, the EU and its member states should offer 30,000 visas and work permits annually for graduates from participating Mediterranean countries.
Such a program would include, first, a traineeship in European firms, followed by the opportunity to work in Europe for 5-8 years.
At the end of that period, participants would receive soft business-startup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin.
Designed for at least a 15-year period, such a program would be a strong signal in itself.
It would show young people from Tunisia, Egypt, and other transformation countries that there are other options than getting on a boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa.
It would be a real incentive to finish one’s university education (indeed, it should be augmented by investment in vocational schools, technical high-schools, and universities in North Africa and the Middle East).
Once implemented, the labor pact would help to change attitudes towards Arab immigrants in Europe – and Europe’s image in the Southern Mediterranean.
It would likely create lasting ties between people and economies.
And it would address real needs in the Southern Mediterranean countries – improving professional skills, reducing the pressure on the local labor market, creating businesses and jobs – as well as in Europe.
Some warn against any programs for “temporary” or “circular” migration.
To be sure, some who benefit would want to stay.
But, while this “burden” might, in fact, benefit aging European countries, the risk is relatively low in the first place: Arab countries entering such a pact would be better governed than they were under the previous regimes.
If they become consolidated democracies, as hoped, would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption.
And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one’s fortune back home.
Such an approach needs to be communicated both to the European public and to the people of Tunisia, Egypt, and other Arab countries.
It would reverse the pattern whereby Europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants.
At long last, these countries’ demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs.
Closing Europe’s Strategy Gap
MADRID – The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year.
But one question has largely escaped thorough examination: what Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine indicates about the European Union’s foreign policy.
During the early stages of the crisis, Germany, which had bet heavily on Russia’s modernization, was averse to taking any consequential action.
But, as the crisis deepened, German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to persuade her European counterparts to implement a broad and biting sanctions regime.
This certainly was a step in the right direction, but it did nothing to address the foreign-policy failings that helped spark the Ukrainian crisis and continue to undermine Europe’s response – namely, the EU’s misguided Neighborhood Policy (ENP) and its muddled approach to energy.
On both of these fronts, the EU’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It increasingly appears that Ukraine is becoming locked in a “frozen conflict” – Russia’s foreign-policy specialty.
Indeed, the situation in Ukraine represents a tactical victory for Russia, with the fragile but enduring ceasefire – and accompanying legislation that grants Donetsk and Luhansk considerable political autonomy – allowing Russia to entrench the conflict near the EU’s border.
Moreover, the delayed implementation of key elements of the EU’s association agreement with Ukraine is clear evidence that, at the moment, Russia dictates the terms of EU-Ukrainian engagement.
In Europe, the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy, particularly in view of Hungary’s decision to suspend gas flows to Ukraine.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government, whose behavior in recent years has been at odds with the EU’s criteria for democracy, now openly approves of authoritarian regimes – and Putin’s, in particular – with serious potential consequences for European unity.
Nonetheless, the timing of the current ceasefire, which coincides with the installation of a new EU Commission, is advantageous, as is Putin’s shortsighted emphasis on tactical victories.
EU leaders should take advantage of the break in the fighting to stop reacting and start anticipating.
With a long-term strategic vision, the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin’s short-term successes.
Such a vision must include a reconceptualization of the ENP.
The program’s mission – to help guide the political, social, and economic transitions of neighboring states – is not inherently problematic; the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued.
For starters, the ENP assumes that all of the EU’s neighbors, both in the south and in the east, ultimately want to realize European values and structures in their own countries.
In other words, the ENP does not account for the developmental, cultural, and aspirational differences among the EU’s partner countries.
The ENP suffers operationally from its excessively technical approach and lack of strategic vision.
For example, before the Ukraine crisis, the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the association agreement that it did not consider adequately the potential fallout of the process – such as, say, a response from Russia.
To be sure, the EU recognized its need for a coherent strategy, and attempted to resolve it by establishing the European External Action Service and the position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs.
But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission, and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension, owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intra-EU disagreements.
It is telling that Ashton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus, such as the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia.
Further eroding Europe’s effectiveness is its fragmented approach to securing energy supplies.
With every country largely controlling its own energy policy, Europe’s energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies.
To the extent that there has been an EU-wide energy strategy, it has related to renewables, rather than the intersection of geopolitics and energy security.
But there is reason for hope.
The new Commission, which its president, Jean Claude Juncker, has restructured significantly, could provide Europe with the strategic leadership it so badly needs.
In fact, Juncker has already expressed a desire to integrate incoming High Representative Federica Mogherini into the Commission’s policy program.
The new structure – which tasks Mogherini with guiding and coordinating the work of multiple commissioners, including those responsible for trade, the ENP, and climate and energy – should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policies, particularly after Mogherini completes her European Council-mandated assessment of the global strategic landscape.
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a reset of Europe’s foreign-policy strategy.
For that to happen, Mogherini must assert herself as a leader, backed by Juncker and the new European Council president, Donald Tusk.
And, most important, all EU member states must recommit themselves to cooperation.
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of Europe’s values.
Indeed, Europe has a large set of tools at its disposal; it just needs to figure out how to use them.
If it can, it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge, but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today’s rapidly shifting global environment.
A Fair Deal for Africa’s Resources
WINDHOEK – Namibia is a resource-based economy that has embarked on an ambitious development program.
Our vision is to turn Namibia into a knowledge-based, diversified economy by 2030.
One of the major principles upon which this vision is based is the idea of “partnerships” – a major prerequisite for the achievement of dynamic, efficient, and sustainable development.
Partnerships between governments and foreign investors are at the core of the sound management of natural resources.
But such partnerships can’t be taken for granted on a continent where the quest for natural resources has fueled decades of violent conflict.
Genuine partnership is difficult to achieve when resource-rich countries view foreign mining and drilling companies only as adversaries, seeking unfair and inequitable contracting agreements.
From the perspective of companies, partnership is unattractive when they are forced to incur large losses owing to project disruptions and contract renegotiations.
By contrast, partnerships are strengthened if companies and governments recognize their shared interest in durable, mutually beneficial contracts that ensure stable revenue streams from projects.
This requires a framework that takes into account, among other things, developmental possibilities, environmental concerns, labor conditions, and community interests, and that is adaptable to changing circumstances.
For governments, contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that enables countries to receive fair and predictable long-term revenues.
For developing countries, this source of income can be substantial over several decades, and is needed by governments for investment in infrastructure, health care, education, etc.
On the other hand, poorly conceived and negotiated contracts not only prevent countries from enjoying the full long-term benefits of their natural resources, but also help to entrench poverty, corruption, and even conflict, particularly when governance systems are inadequate.
For companies, contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that continuously rewards firms for risky and capital-intensive investment in terms of the net present value of their earnings.
Companies also want, of course, contracts that won’t be repudiated by the next government.
Indeed, poorly negotiated contracts are a recipe for adverse business outcomes, such as reduced security of mining titles, increased likelihood of operational disruptions from targeted civil protests, and greater risk of revisions to tax and other conditions.
Many governments in Africa simply don’t have the capacity to negotiate complex contracts that require a wide range of in-depth knowledge of law, finance, geology, economic modeling, etc., while firms typically do.
As a result, the contracts that are negotiated often do not meet the criteria described above – to the disadvantage not only of governments, but also of firms interested in durable contracts.
In the absence of conditions for equitable negotiations, governments often deem the resulting contracts unfair – thus dooming them to be breached at some point.
In these circumstances, there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances.
The outcome of such negotiations can be expected to be – and to be perceived to be – more balanced, more transparent, more stable, and therefore more sustainable.
The time has come to establish such a facility – in the interest of a mutually beneficial partnership between governments and foreign investors.
A Fair Deal for Turkey
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission: open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month, or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway.
At the same time, the Commission’s latest report on Turkey’s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down, further calling into question the country’s future EU membership.
The Commission’s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month. At that meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus?
Has the EU’s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey?
What are the EU’s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey?
If the answers to the first two questions are “no” – as I believe they are – the third question becomes vitally important.
True, Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (Greek) Cyprus, and this is a violation of agreements.
But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership.
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004.
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part. But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it.
Nevertheless, Cyprus became an EU member – but only the Greek part.
This was clearly a mistake, because it made the EU part of the conflict. It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey.
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU’s fairness?
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching, for they have clearly been spurred by Turks’ wish to move closer to the EU.
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal.
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction, towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state.
Therefore, the recent lack of progress in Turkey’s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU’s behavior.
This leaves us with the third question: what kind of Turkey does the EU want?
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU’s interest to see Turkey’s democracy and economy continue to strengthen.
More than 40 years ago, it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership, it will be welcome in the EU.
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously.
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership. But they are reacting to the current situation.
When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner – a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria (democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, and an effective market economy) – many more are inclined to say yes.
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges.
First, they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey, and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans.
Second, they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations.
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors.
Here the Finns, who chair the EU right now, have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict.
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders.
At the same time, a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN’s proposals regarding Cyprus.
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU’s own ranks, so be it.
A Farewell to (Glorious) War
In recent days, Italy’s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country’s troop deployment in Afghanistan, while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
They are increasingly convinced that “victory” will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states, however powerful, and religiously driven armed insurgents.
Donald Rumsfeld’s dogma of military “transformation” – the technological upgrading of an army’s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops – failed resoundingly in Iraq.
Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetric entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980’s nor NATO’s today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield.
When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass no longer equals victory.
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz’s notion of “decisive battles” as the “center of gravity” of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible “center of gravity.”
Indeed, while wars from the time of Hannibal’s defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity, with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees, such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism.
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war.
In fact, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble.
Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states’ use of military force have become more complex than ever.
Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found, such as Israel’s border with Syria, India’s border with Pakistan, and the border dividing the two Koreas.
In such cases, war, as the Egyptians showed in 1973, might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict.
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.
However, in the case of Kashmir, the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence.Indeed, such asymmetric conflicts through proxies have become the new conventional way that states avoid the price of a general war.
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete.
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.
“Victory” cannot bring peace, simply because there will always be a war after the war.
Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict.
Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as it was before.
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched.
It is during the war after the war that the occupier’s inferiority is revealed, with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield.
The insurgents in Iraq, as the British admit, were able in just three years to cope with their enemies’ technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years.
The Iraq war and Israel’s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution.
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts, forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity.
That said, it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary.
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today’s asymmetric conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield.
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results.
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "Revisionist" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations.
For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland.
They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither.
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has diminished.
Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day.
If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he admitted that "eventually" a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers.
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.
The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme.
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.
A Flat World and a Round Ball
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching, now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal.
This year’s Cup, unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002, didn’t witness any real upsets in the first round.
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round, and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat, with only Ghana advancing.
There have been just two ugly matches so far, full of fouls, nasty attacks, and unnecessary aggression, as well as numerous yellow and red cards: Italy vs. the US, and Portugal vs. the Netherlands.
Otherwise, we’re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany, in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere.
As for Germany and the Germans, one hardly recognizes one’s own country and people.
Even Mother Nature has played along.
After a long winter and a non-existent spring, summer started promptly with the first kick-off – and virtually overnight, Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side.
The weather is Mediterranean, and all of a sudden, so are the people.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The Cup’s organization has been exceptional (as was to be expected), with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance.
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world (which was not expected).
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer (which nobody could have expected!).
More importantly, not only in the German team, but also in the country as a whole, a young, cool, laid-back, and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan, friendly, and good-humored.
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace.
Doctors are on strike, taxes are on the rise, the parties in government are mauling each other, and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape.
But the Germans, undaunted by it all, simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world.
The black, red, and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before, but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones.
In fact, the flags of many nations fly alongside German.
In Berlin, as in other large German cities, taxis sport the flags of their drivers’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia.
Fans don not just their nations’ flags, but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries’ colors.
Flags are flown in hope of victory, but also serve to dry the tears of defeat.
In short, Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night’s dream, with a touch of Woodstock to boot.
Outside the stadiums, public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “happenings.”
And how is the soccer?
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone.
First, Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer.
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity.
Second, international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation.
Spain, Argentina, and Germany, to name but a few countries, have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game.
On the French, English, and Portuguese teams, too, it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane, Beckham, and Figo.
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002.
This generational change is accelerated by a third development. At the top international level, soccer has become faster and more athletic, and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively.
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 (or more) minutes, switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team, and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents' movements won’t stand much of a chance.
Here, soccer parallels today’s globalized markets, which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary.
Unlike economic globalization, however, it remains to be seen whether this new, fast-paced style of soccer will prevail (after all, the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France).
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does.
For now, we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new, young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted, enthralling, and beautiful to watch.

Let’s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9, we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible.
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism, because, unfortunately, two universal principles will continue to apply in the future: first, the winter will return, and, second, the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult.
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
Watching the news from Iraq, I recall when I was Poland's Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991.
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad.
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq. ``Yes, I know,'' I said. ``I've been watching the bombardment on TV.''
Twelve years later, Poland's Prime Minister didn't need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq.
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US, now Poland's NATO ally.
Indeed, Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq's occupation.
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism's collapse in 1989!
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Little of this, however, is the result of design, for (unfortunately) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union.
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us.
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing'' we influence Europe's fate; others suffer crippling pessimism, consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class'' status--and you have a recipe for inertia.
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out.

Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset: we say that we want a common foreign and security policy, but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges. Then we squabble about what to do.
The time for such laxity is over.
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO, membership in the Alliance didn't really require debate.
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was theonlyreal option.
EU membership and the global war on terror, however, demand a more deeply considered response.
Why?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state, economy, and society, while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy.
Today's crisis in transatlantic relations, and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld's ``New Europe,'' means that Poland (like every other European state) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO.
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests, as well what it really means to be an EU partner.
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new'' and ``old'' Europe, as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds.
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Instead, the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order.
They see new players (say, Spain) rising to shape EU policy, particularly foreign policy, and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged.
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades.
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse.'' Instead, the EU's structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe's role in the world, but also new means to achieve consensus.
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power.
The world needs a united continent, ready to go into action.
That consensus must include the US.
During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated America's tendency to lead unilaterally, because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power.
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era.
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic, and its belief that Europe's ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won't spend the money necessary to achieve that goal.
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus.
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective.
Intentions don't deter invasions.
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said, ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country's security.
The US is, but security does not come free of charge.''
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is akin to Denmark's.
Indeed, all of Europe is in thrall to American power.
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America.
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth, many of today's divisions will disappear.
The EU's foreign policy should be guided by the following goals:
fight terrorism;
prevent local conflict;
promote human rights and democracy;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
help poor countries.
Polish foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives.
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations, in an expanded Union, and in relations between the ``New'' and ``Old'' Europe.
A Fracking Good Story
PRAGUE – Weather conditions around the world this summer have provided ample fodder for the global warming debate.
Droughts and heat waves are a harbinger of our future, carbon cuts are needed now more than ever, and yet meaningful policies have not been enacted.
But, beyond this well-trodden battlefield, something amazing has happened: Carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States have dropped to their lowest level in 20 years.
Estimating on the basis of data from the US Energy Information Agency (EIA) from the first five months of 2012, this year’s expected CO2 emissions have declined by more than 800 million tons, or 14%, from their peak in 2007.
The cause is an unprecedented switch to natural gas, which emits 45% less carbon per energy unit.
The US used to generate about half its electricity from coal, and roughly 20% from gas.
Over the past five years, those numbers have changed, first slowly and now dramatically: in April of this year, coal’s share in power generation plummeted to just 32%, on par with gas.
America’s rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of technological innovation, particularly the development of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” which has opened up large new resources of previously inaccessible shale gas.
Despite some legitimate concerns about safety, it is hard to overstate the overwhelming benefits.
For starters, fracking has caused gas prices to drop dramatically.
Adjusted for inflation, gas has not been this cheap for the past 35 years, with the price this year 3-5 times lower than it was in the mid-2000’s.
And, while a flagging economy may explain a small portion of the drop in US carbon emissions, the EIA emphasizes that the major explanation is natural gas.
The reduction is even more impressive when one considers that 57 million additional energy consumers were added to the US population over the past two decades.
Indeed, US carbon emissions have dropped some 20% per capita, and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D. Eisenhower left the White House in 1961.
David Victor, an energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, estimates that the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced US emissions by 400-500 megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 per year.
To put that number in perspective, it is about twice the total effect of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world, including the European Union.
It is tempting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for emissions reductions, but the numbers clearly say otherwise.
Accounting for a reduction of 50 Mt of CO2 per year, America’s 30,000 wind turbines reduce emissions by just one-tenth the amount that natural gas does.
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt, and solar panels by a paltry three Mt.
This flies in the face of conventional thinking, which continues to claim that mandating carbon reductions – through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax – is the only way to combat climate change.
But, based on Europe’s experience, such policies are precisely the wrong way to address global warming.
Since 1990, the EU has heavily subsidized solar and wind energy at a cost of more than $20 billion annually.
Yet its per capita CO2 emissions have fallen by less than half of the reduction achieved in the US – even in percentage terms, the US is now doing better.
Because of broad European skepticism about fracking, there is no gas miracle in the EU, while the abundance of heavily subsidized renewables has caused over-achievement of the CO2 target.
Along with the closure of German nuclear power stations, this has led, ironically, to a resurgence of coal.
Well-meaning US politicians have likewise shown how not to tackle global warming with subsidies and tax breaks.
The relatively small reduction in emissions achieved through wind power costs more than $3.3 billion annually, and far smaller reductions from ethanol (biofuels) and solar panels cost at least $8.5 and $3 billion annually.
Estimates suggest that using carbon taxes to achieve a further 330 Mt CO2 reduction in the EU would cost $250 billion per year.
Meanwhile, the fracking bonanza in the US not only delivers a much greater reduction for free, but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs.
The amazing truth is that fracking has succeeded where Kyoto and carbon taxes have failed.
As shown in a study by the Breakthrough Institute, fracking was built on substantial government investment in technological innovation for three decades.
Climate economists repeatedly have pointed out that such energy innovation is the most effective climate solution, because it is the surest way to drive the price of future green energy sources below that of fossil fuels.
By contrast, subsidizing current, ineffective solar power or ethanol mostly wastes money while benefiting special interests.
Fracking is not a panacea, but it really is by far this decade’s best green-energy option.
A Free Lunch for America
BERKELEY – Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year: governments, he said, are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure.
Summers was criticizing Europe’s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances – between the EU’s north and south, and between reckless banks’ creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly – worsen with each passing day.
But, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans have no reason to feel smug.
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States, where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America’s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis.
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively, on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25% per year.
Suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two.
In that case, the $500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $1 trillion of extra output of goods and services, generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment, and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years.
And, with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs, the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future.
The impressive gains don’t stop there.
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $20 billion a year of income and social welfare.
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $20 billion a year in higher production.
And half of the extra $1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households.
In sum, on the benefits side of the equation: more jobs now, $500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years, and then a $40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter.
So, what are the likely costs of an extra $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?
For starters, the $500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity.
So the net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.
American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off or roll over the entire $200 billion.
The $40 billion a year of higher economic activity would, however, generate roughly $10 billion a year in additional tax revenue.
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due, the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt.
In other words, taxpayers win, because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt, enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates.
Households win, too, because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes.
Companies win, because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure.
The unemployed win, because some of them get jobs.
And even bond investors win, because they get their money back, with the interest for which they contracted.
So what is not to like?
Nothing.
How, you might ask, can I say this?
I am an economist – a professor of the Dismal Science, in which there are no free lunches, in which benefits are always balanced by costs, and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are.
But there are two things different about today.
First, the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole.
Second, bond investors are being really stupid.
In a world in which the S&amp;P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year.
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors’ extraordinary and irrational panic.
They are willing to pay 6% per year for “safety.”
Right now, however, the US government can manufacture “safety” out of thin air merely by printing bonds.
The government, too, would then win by pocketing that 6% per year of value – though 30 years from now, bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios’ extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy.
A French Cure for the Resource Curse
NEW YORK – The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and France is leading the effort.
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum, gas, and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges.
France, at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year, is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move.
With French leadership, 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear, precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities.
Oil, gas, and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies.
Moreover, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
Yet, despite great natural wealth, a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty.
The actual taxes and payments made by mining, oil, and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret, even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good.
In reality, in far too many countries, ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money; in fact, they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations.
Indeed, these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions.
Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East.
In these countries, many of which are rich in oil and gas, citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression.
At bottom, they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world’s energy supplies.
Transparency is an essential part of the solution.
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms, as well as mining companies, publish all of their relevant financial information, broken down by country and by project, and including all payments made to host-country public budgets.
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges, this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located.
Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular, timely basis, and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies.
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments, through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
That law’s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90% of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies.
This will help citizens track how that money is used, but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share.
If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers, financial and accounting balances, and payments to authorities, companies would become truly accountable to citizens, and government revenues would be augmented.
Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission, and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance, integrity, and transparency in economic transactions.”
At its just-completed summit in Deauville, France, the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil, gas, and mining companies.
This is an important advance, but, unfortunately, it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative, and it focuses only on payments transparency.
Now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed, given that important emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China, as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries, will be at the table.
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone.
Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives, economies, and political systems around the world.
A French Presidential Primer
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “a week is a long time in politics.”
So, in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election, any prediction made today could be reversed, and reversed again, before the vote.
But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls: Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left.
In fact, they have more in common than meets the eye, for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity.
For Sarkozy, “rupture” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices.
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac‘s presidency, together with France’s tradition of alternation in power, suggests a victory for the left.
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today’s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });This is reflected in Sarkozy’s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high.
Sarkozy’s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America’s military adventure in Iraq, but that their style was disastrously wrong.
Thus, his deep admiration for “American values,” while sincere, implies no embrace of President George W. Bush.
It also reassures the French business community, which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin’s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac’s foreign minister.
At home, Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young, issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, may have lost politically to de Gaulle, but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “false values.”
By contrast, rebelling against one’s parents’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues, such as education and immigration, that may dominate the electoral campaign.
In the case of Royal, the meaning of “rupture” is both more obvious and more visible.
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic.
To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasize her “essence,” thereby countering Sarkozy’s stress on his record as a “doer.”
Her appeal to voters is simple: “I am a woman, and you have never tried a woman, so be modern and try one now.”
Hiding behind the originality (in French presidential politics) of her gender, Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program.
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda, her highly effective line of defense (so far!) has been: “You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman!”
Thus, Royal’s program is her popularity.
In foreign policy, one can only guess what her priorities would be.
As far as Europe is concerned, she seems as “agnostic” as Sarkozy, who, like her, incarnates a new generation of “post-European” leaders.
In terms of values, Royal, too, seems to represent a rupture with May 1968, with her emphasis on discipline and family.
According to public opinion polls, Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy.
Her support is particularly strong among women voters.
For the Socialist Party, which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002, the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal.
In the opinion of Royal’s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants, the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity: the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern.
According to Royal’s Socialist critics, the “Hollywoodization” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead.
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy.
Moreover, both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac’s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture.
Royal openly claims Mitterand’s legacy as she searches for legitimacy, while Sarkozy’s rejection of Chirac’s legacy has more to do with form than substance.
To a large extent, Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more, whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less.
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007, their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations, as it did in 2002, when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round.
As in 2002, the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less.
But one way or the other, personalities will prevail over programs.
A Fresh Start for China and Japan?
Edmonton – Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10, making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there.
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries, and is being watched closely around the world, with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent, to say the least.
When Hu’s predecessor, Jiang Zemin, traveled to Japan ten years ago, bilateral relations were deteriorating: China was unhappy with the Japanese government’s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus turning more confrontational.
The Japanese media’s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative, and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster.
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002, almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan, and encouraged “New Thinking” in China’s Japan policy, which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties.
But, instead of accepting China’s olive branch, Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda, including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shine, which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan’s neighbors.
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005.
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country’s long-term interests.
Koizumi’s successors, Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, have sought to engage China over the past two years, with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year.
Hu’s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen.
He will emphasize common strategic interests, highlight mutual economic benefits, generate positive public opinion, and promote further exchanges.
Japan is not only one of China’s largest trade and investment partners, it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms, partly to showcase that China’s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world.
Japan, whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years, is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity, as least in economic terms.
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the father of today’s prime minister, signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China.
The two governments will certainly use Hu’s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship.
But, unlike three decades ago, when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries, public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones.
Behind the smiles, the polite interactions, and the cautiously worded diplomatic language, strong undercurrents of suspicion remain.
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea.
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection, areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries, the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters, which contain huge potential oil, gas, and other mineral deposits.
Even after many rounds of talks, no resolution is in sight, and Hu’s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs.
Then there are strategic suspicions.
Fukuda has dropped Abe’s talk about an “arch of freedom” – an effort to forge a bloc with the United States, Australia, and India.
But Japan remains concerned about China’s rapidly modernizing military, while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China, especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits.
So, although both sides endorse the idea of a “mutually beneficial strategic relationship,” and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges, mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go.
Moreover, today’s “warm politics, cool economics” trend is the reverse of the “cold politics, warm economics” pattern under Koizumi.
Last year, Japan’s committed investment projects in China fell 24% from 2006, while actual investment volume decreased by 25%, partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment.
Recent food safety issues, such as the “poisoned dumplings” cases, have clearly heightened the Japanese public’s sensitivity about Chinese exports.
Finally, historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems.
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine, 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month, an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni.
And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II, another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes casualties in China.
A Fresh Start for Europe
As Europe’s leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new, slimmed down, Reform Treaty, it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last 50 years of European integration had never taken place.
Let’s then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges, especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deal-making and ramshackle institution-building.
On top of that, let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at “Year Zero” means we would not have a half-century of intra-European cooperation to draw on, the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Let’s suspend our disbelief, then, and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last.
Or, to put it another way, let’s look at our problems in the light of the EU’s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies, and then let’s ask ourselves why the EU isn’t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods.
Broadly, we see three areas in which Europe’s policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better: global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership, the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide, and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU’s own political machinery.
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda.
It needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals, and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful.
On conflict and security issues, Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma’s military regime.
The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage, rather than as a “broad church” in which different viewpoints co-exist.
The aim should be that “soft power” instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with.
That means, of course, that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining – and thus protecting – their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10% of the total population.
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU’s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy.
But they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well, which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU’s policy responses so far.
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities.
Education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make, so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world’s poorest countries.
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy – something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders.
Agreed EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe’s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest.
It won’t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe, but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price.
By much the same token, Europe’s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans’ sense of a shared history and common values.
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable.
Meanwhile, doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals.
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders’ mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union’s decision-making mechanisms, but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries.
We believe, though, that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself.
That way, if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty, it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor, the Constitutional Treaty, was in 2005.
A Gazan Education
GAZA – This was supposed to be my first year of medical school.
Instead, I am stuck here in Gaza, in my father’s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp, with few options and no way out.
After I finished high school last year, I decided to become a doctor.
Gaza cries out for bone specialists, but the training I need is available only abroad. 
When I won a place at a medical college in Germany, my parents were proud.
I was excited to follow my older brother, who is already studying there.
In February, the German authorities granted me an entrance visa.
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe. But I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out – not students.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad.
For many of us, this is our only opportunity to continue our education.
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth, and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide.
The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures, like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery. 
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies.
Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few post-graduate programs.
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza.
Without the ability to go overseas, we cannot learn.
In June, after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with “recognized” scholarships – but not “hundreds.”
So hundreds of us are still waiting, most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world’s attention.
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave.
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism.
My father is a teacher and owns a children’s clothing shop.
My mother is a housekeeper.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia, where my father had been working as a teacher.
That was at the height of the peace process.
My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993, and decided that they could give us a better life here.
But when I was ten, the secondintifada began.
The peace process was collapsing throughout my teenage years.
During my third year of high school, the Israeli authorities closed off the Gaza Strip.
Israeli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a trickle, and have suffocated Gaza’s economy, choking off imports and exports and cutting fuel deliveries and electricity.
There is no clothing left in my father’s shop, which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies.
With the backing of the US, Canada, and the European Union, Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas, which won the elections here in 2006.
But the blockade only makes people more desperate.
Hamas and other armed groups, I know, have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip, including Jabalia.
Israel’s blockade amounts to collective punishment. It is hurting all of us, whether we support Hamas or not.
It is also destroying my dream to write “Specialist in Bone Medicine” after my name.
Sometimes, I am sorry that I am from Gaza.
But my hope is still to go abroad, learn skills, and return to help others here.
Sometimes, when there is electricity, I watch television and see how people live in other places.
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel, to study, to take vacations, when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine.
We are students, not soldiers.
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn’t Israel let us go study?
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds?
Soon, my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes.
When they do, I will probably still be here in my father’s house, waiting for the blockade to end.
A German Conservative Credo
Few concepts are as elastic as that of ``Conservatism.''
At one end of its spectrum of meanings, conservatism has (over the last two decades) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab.
At the other end, conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism. In Germany today, conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic's failures, experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives.
This history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian-Social Union (CSU), who focus on moderation and balance, preservation and innovation, and on commanding Germany's political center.
With federal elections due in Germany this autumn, much will be said about the nature of German conservatism.
Some, looking at CDU/CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber's emphasis on Bavaria's economic success, will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the ``anything goes'' market conservatism practiced in America.
Others, pointing to the German conservatives' emphasis on social values, will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats.
The truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons, which also makes it more durable.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });CDU/CSU policies are, of course, founded on the idea of individual freedom, but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition.
We are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man's sins, but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany's 20th century history.
Yet, despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature, we embrace humanity's talent for progress and innovation, because we recognize man's ability to correct mistakes and errors.
These two traits, although they seem to conflict, and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives, nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires.
Far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way, German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state, the market, and the individual.
We conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts, such as those that exist between freedom and security.
Each, indeed, is unsustainable without the other.
Security is useless without freedom, but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security.
The social market economy, which we continue to embrace, is based on these principles.
It sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth, but also embraces state interference, when necessary, to secure equality of opportunity, social solidarity, and social balance.
This interference is also intended to help avoid the ``economization'' of all aspects of civic life.
The market is merely a tool, not an answer to every human problem.
It is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive, for example, to strike a balance between economy and ecology.
We feel responsible, on a global level, for the environment, which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world.
For globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity.
As we open ourselves to the wind's of globalization, we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity, such as the family, local and regional communities, religious communities, and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years.
This is the principle of ``subsidiarity'' which supports placing decision-making power, wherever and whenever possible, in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen.
This is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union, where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe.
For German conservatives, European integration and national identity are not warring concepts, as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others.
They are, instead, two sides of the same coin.
The EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation.
Decades later, the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations, as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations, because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure.
In essence, the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept.
Indeed, only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance, and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy.
In a fast changing world, this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike.
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism, for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future.
Moderation, tolerance, and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today's German conservatism.
A German Europe?
LISBON/RIGA – Is the Europe that is emerging from the euro crisis a German one?
During the euro crisis, power in the European Union seems to have shifted towards national capitals in general, and towards one national capital in particular: Berlin.
But, with Germany introverted, France downgraded, and Britain semi-detached, the big story in European foreign policy is that the time has come for the little guy who thinks big.
In this Europe, the important moves are now sometimes made in Stockholm or Warsaw, not only in Berlin, Paris, or London.
And, with major foreign-policy issues on Europe’s doorstep – whether in Egypt, Belarus, or now Syria – useful European initiatives are to be welcomed, regardless of where they originate.
Germany, in foreign policy as well as in economics, can exert decisive leadership in the EU – when it wants to.
For example, together with Poland, it led the EU’s attempt to develop a coordinated approach to Russia, and it flexed its muscles on Serbia.
But, on other issues – for example, Libya – Germany did not so much lead as use its newfound room for maneuver to follow its own preferences in the face of other EU members.
So the answer today to Henry Kissinger’s famous question about whom he should call when he wants to speak to Europe, is not necessarily “the German chancellor.”
While Berlin is increasingly imposing its economic preferences on others in the eurozone, it is not prepared to use military force as a foreign-policy tool, as it demonstrated in the case of Libya.
Moreover, Germany, it seems, is becoming a “geo-economic power” driven by the needs of its export sector.
By using economic means to pursue its foreign-policy ends, Germany is gradually turning its back on its European partners.
Meanwhile, as France experiences a loss of power relative to Germany on economic issues, it continues to play a decisive role in foreign policy.
France led the Libya operation, and is doing much the same with attempts to impose stronger sanctions against Iran and provide support for the United Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.
But France’s unilateral approach often antagonizes its European partners.
For example, French President Nicolas Sarkozy preempted a common European position on the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN in September.
In other words, even when France leads, it does not always do so in a constructive way.
Apart from the decisive role that it played in Libya alongside France, Britain is becoming increasingly marginal in European foreign policymaking.
Even before it vetoed a plan by eurozone countries to create a “fiscal union” at the European summit in December 2011, it was playing less of a leadership role than it traditionally has on key European foreign-policy issues.
Britain has continued to support EU enlargement, closer links with Turkey, and development in Africa, but it has not launched any creative initiatives to bring other member states along or change the terms of the EU debate.
On other issues, such as engaging “strategic partners” – China and Russia in particular – the United Kingdom is often a follower as well.
As the “big three” increasingly pursue their own narrowly defined national interests, however, other EU member states are emerging as leaders in key foreign-policy fields.
For example, Sweden – the 14th largest member state in terms of population, and eighth in terms of GDP – under the leadership of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt punches considerably above its weight.
Last year, it increased annual aid to North Africa by SEK100 million (€11.1 million), proposed an EU mission to Tunisia just a week after the revolution to support democratic aspirations there, and was an early and strong backer of UN resolutions in support of the uprising in Libya.
Poland, too, is emerging as a foreign-policy leader.
Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski have particularly taken the initiative on the EU’s strategy towards Russia, where Poland has largely overcome its differences with Germany and is now at the forefront of efforts to develop a genuinely comprehensive approach.
Poland has also led on European defense (though it declined to take part in the military intervention in Libya).
This reflects the strength of the Polish economy, which is expected to grow by more than 3% in 2012 – faster than almost anywhere else in the EU.
Germany might be getting all of the attention in this time of crisis, but the last year has been a reminder that Europe is most effective and influential when the small countries get involved and join forces with – and even lead – the big ones.
For example, on Iran (with exceptions like Greece), Europeans have united around a clear policy and collective positions, such as an oil embargo.
So, Poland and Sweden:&nbsp; Europe needs your leadership.
But that might not be enough in an EU with more than 500 million citizens.
Other EU states need to follow their example in order to make European foreign policy truly effective and influential.
A Global Agenda for Seven Billion
NEW YORK – Late next month, a child will be born – the 7th billion citizen of planet Earth. We will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born.
We do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change – environmental, economic, geopolitical, technological, and demographic.
The world’s population has tripled since the United Nations was created in 1945.
And our numbers keep growing, with corresponding pressures on land, energy, food, and water. The global economy is generating pressures as well: rising joblessness, widening social inequalities, and the emergence of new economic powers.
These trends link the fate and future of today’s seven billion people as never before. No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century. International cooperation is a universal need.

The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow, short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity’s long-term imperatives.
At a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges, we need to forge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice.
To help create this future, I am focusing my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives – five generational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today.

The first and greatest of these imperatives is sustainable development. We all must understand that saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, and advancing economic growth are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security, and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.

In the next five years, we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement.
Fostering economic growth, realizing the Millennium Development Goals, and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet.
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity.
This year, the UN peacekeeping budget will total $8 billion. Think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts – by deploying political mediation missions, for example, rather than troops.
We know how to do this.
Our record proves it – in Guinea, Kenya, and Kyrgyzstan.
A third imperative is building a safer and more secure world. In this effort, we must be courageous in standing up for democracy, human rights, and peace.
This year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace – in Côte d’Ivoire, Darfur, Egypt, and elsewhere. But hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace.  
In the Middle East, we must break the stalemate.
Palestinians deserve a state.
Israel needs security.
Both want peace. A negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes, and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace.
So, too, will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sierra Leone. And, in the name of all of humanity, we will continue to push forward on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in service of realizing a world free of nuclear weapons.
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition.
This year’s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe.
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all.
In Libya, we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country’s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order, consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people.
Syria is a special concern.
For six months we have seen escalating violence and repression.
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people.
It has not done so.
The moment to act is now.
The violence must stop.
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people.  
Women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world’s unrealized potential.
We need their full engagement – in government, business, and civil society.
The UN has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the Organization and this year, for the first time, UN Women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world.
Seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world’s great global challenges.
They hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations.
Our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause.
Let our common agenda begin.
A Global Civics Lesson
ISTANBUL – The reality of the world’s epic interdependence is well known.
We have seen how financial engineering in the United States can determine economic growth in every part of the world; how carbon-dioxide emissions from China end up influencing crop yields and livelihoods in Vietnam, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and beyond; how an epidemic in Mexico endangers the rhythm of public life in the US; or how volcanic ash from Iceland affects travel across Europe.
We are also familiar with the inherent difficulties of devising and implementing solutions to global problems through nation-states, and have relied on two broad models to deal with this predicament.
The first is composed of a wide range of creative ad hoc alliances and solutions.
When standard global public health instruments proved insufficient, for example, we built the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis, AIDS, and Malaria.
When the Internet became global, its management was turned over to ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which enlists the voices of individual Internet users in its governance – a significant departure from intergovernmental multilateralism.
The US, as the most powerful member of the international system, tends to prefer ad hoc approaches to global governance.
With its vast resources and alliances, ad hoc solutions allow the US to advance its interests effectively without the entanglements of more enduring rules, customs, and structures.
Europeans prefer a more systematic reliance on the rule of law, and also on what has come to be known as the global public-goods paradigm.
Adherents of this view point first and foremost to the existence of certain vital global public goods, climate being the most obvious example.
By definition, public goods mean a collective-action problem.
The global public-goods paradigm also implies some commensurability, if not uniformity, in the way we respond to various global collective-action challenges.
Americans tend to find this expectation of commensurability suffocating, while Europeans find it reassuring and liberating.
(The developing world has been largely absent in this debate, with notable exceptions in the form of indignation about unfairness built into the status quo, peppered with obstructionism.)
Like many other cardinal questions, the tension between these approaches is unlikely to be resolved conclusively.
We are more likely to live with this tension for a long time, with emphasis shifting back and forth between approaches.
It would thus be much more worthwhile to focus on a neglected issue: what responsibilities do we all have toward people who happen not to be our compatriots?
Both the ad hoc and the global public-goods schools shy away from this question, and yet without at least some working answer, we will lack the compass needed to navigate our increasing global interdependence.
We need to recognize that global governance is not a technocratic puzzle to be solved by clever institutional design.
We cannot establish an effective social contract without an explicit understanding of our responsibilities towards each other – and of the rights that emerge alongside those responsibilities.
The answers are to be found not only in the speeches given at the United Nations General Assembly or at the Davos World Economic Forum, but in the conversations we have with our friends, families, and colleagues.
We must all consider what responsibilities we are willingly ready to accept, and then discuss our answers with others.
This will mean starting to imagine – without panic or rush, and with all the care and thoughtfulness that this conversation requires – a global civics.
Current and probable future levels of global connectivity and interdependence enable and require us to commence this conversation.
Whether or not we realize it, we have comparable conversations every day.
For example, every day millions of people drive at high speeds encased in a ton of metal, and they do so extremely close to others who are doing the same thing.
A slight move of the steering wheel in the wrong direction would wreak havoc, but we cruise carefree, because we have reasonable expectations about the behavior of other drivers.
Our expectations of other drivers, which serve to mitigate the theoretical risks of driving, can exist because people adhere to a framework of laws, habits, and conventions about how to operate automobiles.
In an increasingly interdependent world, we need a corresponding global framework to put our minds at relative ease.
That framework has to be based on global civics, a system of conscious responsibilities that we are ready to take on – and corresponding rights that we are ready to claim – after due deliberation.
To imagine the shape of global civics, a worthwhile exercise would be to take 15 minutes to consider what we would say to the seven billionth human being – who will join us in less than a thousand days – about the human condition awaiting her.
This hypothetical conversation would help us take stock of global conditions that we have all helped produce, and would set us on a path toward discovering our core responsibilities to each other and the next generation – the essence of global civics.
A Global Green New Deal
NAIROBI – With unemployment soaring, bankruptcies climbing, and stock markets in free-fall, it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold.
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate, as well as inter-generational, proportions.
Far from burdening an already over-stressed, over-stretched global economy, environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work, get order books flowing, and assist in powering economies back to health.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In the past, concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury; today, it is a necessity – a point grasped by some, but by no means all, economic architects yet.
A big slice of President Barack Obama’s $825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy, “weatherizing” a million homes, and upgrading the country’s inefficient electricity grid.
Such investments could generate an estimated five million “green-collar” jobs, provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries, and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security.
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times.
President Lee Myung-Bak’s government plans to invest $38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities.
Other elements of Lee’s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills. The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies.
Similar pro-employment “Green New Deal” packages have been lined up in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs, fighting poverty, and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports.
In South Africa, the government-backedWorking for Water initiative – which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, youth, and the disabled – also sees opportunity in crisis.
The country spends roughly $60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife, water supplies, important tourism destinations, and farmland.
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel.
As a result, an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equal to 2% of the country’s electricity needs, will be generated, along with more than 5,000 jobs.
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery.
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80% of Africans who have no access to electricity.
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit.
In early February, the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world’s leading economists at the UN’s headquarters in New York.
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal, tailored to different national challenges, will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts.
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise.
Spent wisely, however, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends, setting the stage for a more sustainable, urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century.
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes, together with the trillions of investors’ dollars waiting in the wings, represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago: the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss.
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children’s future.
Instead, political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and encourage new patterns of decent, long-lasting employment.
A Global Perfect Storm
NEW YORK – Dark, lowering financial and economic clouds are, it seems, rolling in from every direction: the eurozone, the United States, China, and elsewhere.
Indeed, the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter.
For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening, as the euro remains too strong, front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries, and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery.
The eurozone banking system is becoming balkanized, as cross-border and interbank credit lines are cut off, and capital flight could turn into a full run on periphery banks if, as is likely, Greece stages a disorderly euro exit in the next few months.
Moreover, fiscal and sovereign-debt strains are becoming worse as interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peak levels.
Indeed, the eurozone may require not just an international bailout of banks (as recently in Spain), but also a full sovereign bailout at a time when eurozone and international firewalls are insufficient to the task of backstopping both Spain and Italy.
As a result, disorderly breakup of the eurozone remains possible.
Farther to the west, US economic performance is weakening, with first-quarter growth a miserly 1.9% – well below potential.
And job creation faltered in April and May, so the US may reach stall speed by year end.
Worse, the risk of a double-dip recession next year is rising: even if what looks like a looming US fiscal cliff turns out to be only a smaller source of drag, the likely increase in some taxes and reduction of some transfer payments will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption.
Moreover, political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins November’s presidential election.
Thus, new fights on the debt ceiling, risks of a government shutdown, and rating downgrades could further depress consumer and business confidence, reducing spending and accelerating a flight to safety that would exacerbate the fall in stock markets.
In the east, China, its growth model unsustainable, could be underwater by 2013, as its investment bust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late.
A new Chinese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national savings and increase consumption’s share of GDP; but divisions within the leadership about the pace of reform, together with the likelihood of a bumpy political transition, suggest that reform will occur at a pace that simply is not fast enough.
The economic slowdown in the US, the eurozone, and China already implies a massive drag on growth in other emerging markets, owing to their trade and financial links with the US and the European Union (that is, no “decoupling” has occurred).
At the same time, the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets, together with their move towards greater state capitalism, is hampering growth and will reduce their resiliency.
Finally, long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a boil by 2013.
The current negotiations are likely to fail, and even tightened sanctions may not stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons.
With the US and Israel unwilling to accept containment of a nuclear Iran by deterrence, a military confrontation in 2013 would lead to a massive oil price spike and global recession.
These risks are already exacerbating the economic slowdown: equity markets are falling everywhere, leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending.
Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns, credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies, and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries’ income.
Increasing risk aversion is leading economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see stance that makes the slowdown partly self-fulfilling.
Compared to 2008-2009, when policymakers had ample space to act, monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of policy bullets (or, more cynically, policy rabbits to pull out of their hats).
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing.
Indeed, economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems, but rather credit and insolvency crises.
Meanwhile, unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus.
Using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public deleveraging is suppressing domestic demand in countries that are running current-account deficits and structural issues are having the same effect in surplus countries. After all, a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others.
Meanwhile, the ability to backstop, ring-fence, and bail out banks and other financial institutions is constrained by politics and near-insolvent sovereigns’ inability to absorb additional losses from their banking systems.
As a result, sovereign risk is now becoming banking risk. Indeed, sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks’ balance sheet, especially in the eurozone.
To prevent a disorderly outcome in the eurozone, today’s fiscal austerity should be much more gradual, a growth compact should complement the EU’s new fiscal compact, and a fiscal union with debt mutualization (Eurobonds) should be implemented.&nbsp; In addition, a full banking union, starting with eurozone-wide deposit insurance, should be initiated, and moves toward greater political integration must be considered, even as Greece leaves the eurozone.
Unfortunately, Germany resists all of these key policy measures, as it is fixated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic, fiscal, and banking integration.
As a result, the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising.
And, while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst, it is not the only one threatening the global economy.
Batten down the hatches.
A Global Solutions Network
NEW YORK – Great social change occurs in several ways.
A technological breakthrough – the steam engine, computers, the Internet – may play a leading role.
Visionaries, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela, may inspire a demand for justice.
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
Our own generation urgently needs to spur another era of great social change.
This time, we must act to save the planet from a human-induced environmental catastrophe.
Each of us senses this challenge almost daily.
Heat waves, droughts, floods, forest fires, retreating glaciers, polluted rivers, and extreme storms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate, owing to human activities.
Our $70-trillion-per-year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment.
We will need new technologies, behaviors, and ethics, supported by solid evidence, to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is taking on this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the crossroads of global politics and society.
At the political level, the UN is the meeting place for 193 member states to negotiate and create international law, as in the important treaty on climate change adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.
At the level of global society, the UN represents the world’s citizenry, “we the peoples,” as it says in the UN Charter.&nbsp; At the societal level, the UN is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us, including future generations.
In the past two decades, governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats.
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.
Ban knows that strong government action remains vital, but he also recognizes that civil society must also play a larger role, especially because too many governments and politicians are beholden to vested interests, and too few politicians think in time horizons that extend past the next election.
To empower global society to act, Ban has launched a bold new global initiative, for which I am grateful to volunteer.
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
The idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new, cutting-edge approaches to sustainable development around the world.
The network will work alongside and support governments, UN agencies, civil-society organizations, and the private sector.
Humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy, grow food sustainably, build livable cities, and manage the global commons of oceans, biodiversity, and the atmosphere.
But time is running very short.
Today’s mega-cities, for example, already have to confront dangerous heat waves, rising sea levels, more extreme storms, dire congestion, and air and water pollution.
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility.
And as one region in one part of the world designs a better way to manage its transport, energy needs, water supplies, or food supplies, those successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base, enabling other regions to benefit rapidly as well.
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network.
Exactly 150 years ago, in 1862, Abraham Lincoln created America’s “land-grant” universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science.
Today, we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction, clean energy, sustainable food supplies, and the rest.
By linking together, and putting their curricula online, the world’s universities can become even more effective in discovering and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems.
The world’s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development.
Now the corporate sector has two faces.
It is the repository of cutting-edge sustainable technologies, pioneering research and development, world-class management, and leadership in environmental sustainability.
Yet at the same time, the corporate sector lobbies aggressively to gut environmental regulations, slash corporate-tax rates, and avoid their own responsibility for ecological destruction.
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide.
We urgently need far-sighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
These companies are uniquely placed to move new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects, thereby accelerating global learning cycles.
Equally important, we need a critical mass of respected corporate leaders to press their peers to cease the anti-environmental lobbying and campaign-finance practices that account for the inaction of governments.&nbsp;
Sustainable development is a generational challenge, not a short-term task.
The reinvention of energy, food, transport, and other systems will take decades, not years.
But the long-term nature of this challenge must not lull us into inaction.
We must start reinventing our productive systems now, precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing.&nbsp;
At the Rio+20 Summit this past June, the world’s governments agreed to adopt a new set of goals on sustainable development for the period after 2015, to build upon the Millennium Development Goals’ success in reducing poverty, hunger, and disease.
In the post-2015 era, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand, reinforcing each other.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-2015 goals in an open, participatory, and knowledge-based way.&nbsp;
The Secretary General’s launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore especially timely.
Not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development, but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives.&nbsp;
A Good Rate Hike for Europe
Two wrongs don’t make a right.
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents’ tables doesn’t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone.
That may sound obvious, but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating.
For example, Italian politicians, who, given Italy’s recent dismal economic performance, would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy, are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts.
Echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain “if someone is pushing on the brake pedal.”
Who’s he kidding?
If anyone is “pushing down on the Italian growth brake” it is Berlusconi himself.
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy’s lame economic performance.
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy.
More than the usual “blame game” is at work here.
Pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates – and Berlusconi and Co.’s attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy.
Soaring energy prices, for example, have become a leading inflation risk.
But higher energy prices, by themselves, will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger.
The key will be so-called “second-round effects” – whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions.
So far, the “social partners,” as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions, have been quiet.
Should this change, the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe’s economic growth remains slack.
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up (even in Italy).
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak — the euro-zone average was only 0.3% year on year – third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year.
Only consumption is lagging.
How will the ECB react to better economic news?
Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low, at 2%, for so long (more than two years).
True, there is no inflation problem in the short run, but the ECB’s monetary policy focuses on the medium term.
One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB’s benchmark level, indicating an excess supply of liquidity.
It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question.
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the ECB’s Governing Council.
This will change, however, once the economic pick-up is confirmed.
Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now.
Meanwhile, in Germany, the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy.
Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats’ candidate, is a reformer, holding out hope for Germany’s future – and that of Europe.
Unfortunately, Merkel’s campaign is off to a rocky start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine’s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.
This would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes.
Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely, companies might hold off on investment, while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policy would be even less clear than it is now.
On the other hand, a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action.
This raises an interesting point.
The public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates, because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way, and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed.
A hike, in other words, would indicate that good things are happening.
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth.
Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi, who have failed to put bread on the table, their minions in the media, and Keynesian economic professors who don’t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view.
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth.
A Good Year for God
LONDON – It’s been a better year for God.
After withering literary assaults on the Almighty from the Oxford academic Richard Dawkins, the essayist Christopher Hitchens, and others, believers have hit back.
Best of all has been The Case for God by the brilliant religion writer Karen Armstrong.
More important still is the news that more people (certainly in Britain) are going to Christian churches of all denominations.
Moreover, the Pope made a very successful visit to Britain in September.
We know already about heavy attendance at the country’s mosques.
At this time of year, of course, many Christians who are not regular churchgoers attend the Nativity services.
Carols, church bells, and mangers are still at the heart of mid-winter festivities, alongside the consumer binge.
This year, however, the “big spend” in Europe may have been inhibited by the big winter freeze and the big austerity programs across most of the continent.
Even in the most Godless households, most children in Western societies probably know the details of the Christmas story.
The travelers who can find no room at the inn.
The birth of a baby in the stables.
The arrival of the wise men bearing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
We learn about all this at the same time as we are told about Father Christmas, his Lapland reindeers, and his sacks full of presents.
We rapidly lose our belief in that winter myth.
But we tend to retain into adulthood the same views of God that we formed in childhood.
An old man with a long beard watches over us, and most of us retain a pretty literal opinion of the stories about his Son told in the Bible’s New Testament.
It is this God that atheists like Dawkins and Hitchens attack.
And, with such a target, it is not very difficult to poke holes and pile on the ridicule.
Leave aside the fact that you can make an even stronger case against Godlessness – remember the atrocities of atheist totalitarians in the twentieth century – and consider the assault on those whose commitment to literal interpretations of religious texts means that they deny science and reason.
To them the world was made in six days; evolution is a fanciful tale.
Those of us who think that science and religion dwell in different domains, and who recall that Socrates argued that science did not teach you about morality or meaning, find that our case is undermined by the literalists and fundamentalists in every religion.
There are Christians who know all about the fire and brimstone of the Book of Revelation, but seem not to have heard the instructions about generosity in the Sermon on the Mount.
Likewise, there are hard-line Jews, such as the settler groups who drive Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem and Hebron, who have forgotten the early teachings of Jewish scholars who argued that strangers should be treated like your own people.
And there are Muslims who ignore the Koran’s commands of pluralism, tolerance, and peace.
Where the atheist assault is often correct is in pinpointing the amount of harm frequently done in our world by such fundamentalists.
Right-wing American attitudes about their country’s place in the world are invigorated by fundamentalist dogma.
The United Nations is the devil’s own creation.
President Barack Obama is an un-American Muslim.
Palestine from the Jordan River to the coast should be handed to Israel so that the world can end with a cataclysmic Christian triumph.
Jewish fundamentalists obstruct any peace process that is left in the Middle East and build more illegal settlements.
Islamic fundamentalists define jihad as a war of terror against the West and call for an Islamic caliphate from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
The strident and damaging dogmatism of fundamentalists of every stripe has a common feature: a truculent sense of grievance, rooted in fear and resentment of modernity.
Christian fundamentalism in America harks back to nineteenth-century populism and anti-intellectualism.
Members of evangelical churches associate their beliefs with the rugged individualism of the early pioneers.
They are contemptuous of the establishment.
Jewish fundamentalists believe that Israel’s critics are anti-Semitic or, in the case of Jewish opponents of Israel’s harder-line policies, “self-hating Jews.”
Islamic fundamentalists reckon that what the rest of us regard as the liberalizing influence of technological progress and globalization is a brash re-run of Western colonialism.
For a happier New Year, we should listen to the core messages of all these great religions, above all the Confucian golden rule that we should never do to others what we would not like to be done to us.
What religion should teach us is not how to hate, but – to borrow again from Confucius – how to develop societies that look after and welcome the poor, the stranger, and the oppressed.
That is the most important message for everyone, atheists included, to take from the Christian story of Christmas.
A Grand Bargain with Iran
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie.
Though Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel’s old alliance with Iran, the two countries continued to conduct business with America’s blessing.
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980’s, through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point.
Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment, shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change.
It was during Yitzhak Rabin’s government in the early 1990’s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict, owing to the changing strategic environment after America’s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo accords, Israel’s peace agreement with Jordan, a near-rapprochement with Syria, and Israel’s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar – was an increasingly isolated Iran’s worst nightmare.
It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran, two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East, chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms.
The conflict was now between Israel, a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire, and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians.
More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such, the Mullahs’ resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran’s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader.
Ironically, Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy, for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq.
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran, but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching.
As an anti-status quo power, Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order.
But Israel has every reason to be concerned, for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge – the core rationale of Israel’s own strategy of “nuclear ambiguity” – and would embolden its enemies throughout the region.
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way.
A military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is too dangerous, and its results uncertain.
And, however severe economic sanctions might be, they might not bring Iran to its knees.
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon.
However, being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism.
In the American-Iranian equation it was the US, not Iran, that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy.
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War, but was left out of the Madrid peace conference.
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And, when US forces overran Saddam Hussein’s army in the spring of 2003, the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table, from the nuclear issue to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas.
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process.
But, neo-conservative haughtiness – “We don’t speak to evil” – ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran’s demarche.
Iran’s mood changed by the time America’s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift, but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse.
This would not be achieved, however, through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime, or by America’s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran’s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race.
Iran’s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures, which are far lower than those of its enemies, but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power.
There is no better way to undercut Iran’s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, accompanied by massive investments in human development, and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East, including Israel.
A Gravity Test for the Euro
CAMBRIDGE – Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, I find today’s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious.
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments’ latest “comprehensive package” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.
Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems.
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
Let’s begin with why the euro needs to fall.
Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union, which can lead only through constitutional change, the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.
That may work in the short term, but if sovereign default risks materialize – as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely – the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized.
And, if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation.
Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high.
Given this, what arguments support the current value of the euro, or its further rise?
First, investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario, the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.
But, while this scenario has a certain ring of truth, surely any breakup would be highly traumatic, with the euro diving before its rump form recovered.
Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value.
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere.
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value.
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies.
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.
If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro’s strength, the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee, just as private investors would, only in a faster and more concentrated way.
Fourth, investors may believe that, ultimately, US risks are just as large as Europe’s.
True, the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits.
Whereas the US Congress’s “supercommittee,” charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package, will likely come up with a proposal, it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year.
Moreover, investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “quantitative easing,” which would further drive down the dollar.
Fifth, the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis.&#160; An exchange rate of $1.4:€1 is cheap for Germany’s export powerhouse, which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro.
For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage.
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis, wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards, even as productivity has remained stagnant.
But, because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone’s north and south, one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range.
Finally, investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders’ latest plan will work, even though the last dozen plans have failed.
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time, but not for all of the countries anytime soon.
So, yes, there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro, despite its drawn-out crisis, has remained so firm against the dollar so far.
But don’t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead.
A Greek Catch-22
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
The latest package to cope with Greece’s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country’s debt burden.
In essence, this is a back-door debt restructuring: Europe’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts, thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default.
A recurrent characteristic of Europe’s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent.
Indeed, many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980’s.
Bolivia’s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt, an operation funded by international donors, is a classic example.
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case: Ecuador in 2008.
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign (debt repudiation was part of his platform), and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch.
The reasons invoked by Correa (legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange) were beside the point.
The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back at a discount through the back door.
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico, which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off “vulture” investors.
To speed things up, after the default was declared in December 2008, Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders, to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned.
With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands, and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff, the operation was a success.
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks.
The first concerns the market response.
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields, it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador’s behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices, could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange.
This is particularly notable, given that Ecuador’s was perhaps the first opportunistic default (triggered by unwillingness, rather than inability, to pay) in recent history.
The second lesson, and the one most pertinent to Europe now, concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario.
Indeed, almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount.
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a “credit event” in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices.
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement (that is, that private bondholders take a real hit) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005.
In Uruguay, what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief; in Argentina, a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50%.
So the question arises: how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt, the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out.
Only the probability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts – can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount.
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring.
In other words, a successful buyback is a preamble to default.
Can Greece, with the EFSF’s help, obtain debt relief while avoiding default?
Small purchases at current panic prices, vulture-fund style, are always possible, but they do not promise substantial debt relief.
Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market, defeating the point of the whole operation.
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced.
But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way, say, by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market?
Naturally, the spread would automatically converge to the threshold, but how much would be sold?
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders?
If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount, the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal.
After all, by capping spreads, the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside – a good reason, perhaps, to make the facility a temporary offer.
By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels, purchases will be more substantive, but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders.
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22: to succeed in inducing a haircut, it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate.
Without Ecuador’s gimmicks, buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece’s debt overhang.
A Green Return to European Growth
THE HAGUE – Mitigating climate change is often presented as imposing a trade-off between the economy and the environment.
For too long, the debate has been framed around the concept of “burden-sharing.”
But new analysis by a team from six leading European universities and institutes casts new light on this debate, and shows that Europe can make choices that are in its own best economic and environmental interest.
The analysis contained in our new report, A New Growth Path for Europe – Generating Prosperity and Jobs in the Low-Carbon Economy, is based on a comprehensive assessment of European growth prospects in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
Its publication is timely, because the European Union will decide this year whether to raise its target for greenhouse-gas reduction.
Increasing the current emissions target from -20% to -30% by 2020 compared to 1990 would represent an important opportunity to revitalize the European economy – independently of what the rest of the world did in terms of climate policy.
Over the coming decade, seizing that opportunity would increase the size of Europe’s economy considerably – by up to 5% over the next decade.
This translates into six million new jobs and an increase in GDP of up to €800 billion by 2020.
The reason for these results is straightforward: increasing Europe’s climate-policy efforts boosts investments, thus inducing learning-by-doing, especially when these efforts are channeled into new technologies like renewable energy and advanced construction materials.
Learning-by-doing, in turn, increases competitiveness and spurs economic growth, thereby improving investors’ expectations – and inducing further investment.
Unfortunately, studies of the economic impact of a -30% target have relied on traditional equilibrium models that neglect these multiplier effects.
Their estimates of the economic consequences of raising the target result in moderate additional costs, ranging from 0-2% of GDP in 2020.
The new study uses an approach similar to that underpinning Germany’s 2020 emissions-reduction target of -40%.
At last year’s United Nations-sponsored climate-change conference in Cancún, Mexico, German Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen noted that, “In Germany, there has been a shift in thinking over the past years: in industry, politics, and society, we now see climate policy as an opportunity and challenge, not as a threat.”
Röttgen is right.
Imagine a gathering of textile entrepreneurs in 1800 debating whether to introduce steam machines to mechanize their cotton mills.
One of them calculates that the costs would be prohibitive across their hundreds of plants.
If the rest accepted this bottom-up calculation, society would miss out on the 0.5% boost to annual growth that this radical innovation ultimately brought about.
The benefit to the entire economy was bigger than the sum of the benefits for the individual mills.
It was not the invention of the steam engine alone that deserves the credit.
Then as now, such breakthroughs generate a cascade of learning and innovation as suppliers, contractors. and customers adapt to a new way of operating.
Every new major technological idea – the steam engine, railways, or the personal computer – adds up to a boost to growth.
A New Growth Path for Europe shows how investing in energy efficiency and clean energy has the same potential to revitalize Europe today.
Indeed, Josef Ackermann, Chairman of Deutsche Bank, recently said that such investments augur “a new industrial revolution – a revolution that will transform the way we live.”
The analysis shows how all major economic sectors – including many energy-intensive industries – will grow.
For example, energy-efficient buildings are a boon to the cement and chemical industries.
Obviously, the fossil-fuel sector would shrink by 2020 as the energy system decarbonizes, with coal being partly displaced by lower-carbon fuels, mainly gas and renewables (carbon capture and storage and nuclear power cannot make much of a difference by 2020).
The new EU member states, which have lower energy efficiency, stand to benefit the most – though substantial hurdles must be overcome with additional support mechanisms.
Because the financial crisis has lowered greenhouse-gas emissions, the -20% reduction target set before the crisis is no longer challenging enough to catalyze a structural shift in the European economy.
And, as scientists become gloomier and underline the urgency of tackling climate change, economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about the opportunities implied by a low-carbon future.
A New Growth Path for Europe supports that optimism, and it calls on the EU to act accordingly.
An Arab Marshall Plan
OXFORD – The wave of revolts that swept across the Arab world two years ago were fueled by demands for freedom, bread, and social justice.
But, although the revolutions toppled dictators and transformed societies, these core objectives remain as distant as ever.
In fact, the economic challenges facing the Arab Spring countries have become even more pressing, weighing heavily on these countries’ political prospects.
Unemployment has nearly doubled in Tunisia and Egypt, and foreign direct investment has dried up across the Arab world.
Tourism revenues, while resilient, are declining, and fiscal challenges remain considerable.
But the economic urgency is not reflected in the policy response, which has been painfully slow or non-existent.
For example, Egypt’s fiscal deficit will exceed 11% of GDP this year.
But the country’s leaders have been stalling on the terms of a much-needed International Monetary Fund loan.
The government’s reduction of fuel subsidies last year was not followed by additional reforms, and the required tax increase was delayed soon after President Mohamed Morsi announced it.
Almost all political stakeholders in Egypt, as in the other Arab countries in transition, recognize the need for economic reform.
But neither citizens nor policymakers appear willing to bear its social and political costs.
In a charged and uncertain political climate, in which new crises erupt on a daily basis, it is unsurprising that economic reform has been postponed repeatedly.
Politicians know that macroeconomic stabilization and social cohesion can be irreconcilable in the short run.
Slashing food and energy subsidies in order to reduce fiscal strain is unlikely to win favor in a country like Egypt, where 40% of per capita income is allocated to food.
Politics is thus constraining efforts to strengthen public finances.
At the same time, narrow IMF prescriptions threaten to exacerbate political instability, with citizens no longer afraid to take to the streets to demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
The current impasse on economic reform highlights a larger point: subsidy and tax regimes cannot be reformed without first redefining the underlying social contract, which has long exchanged welfare distribution for political acquiescence.
But such a move is far too risky for an individual politician, or even a single country, at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment.
In order to create the political space needed for economic reform, Arab leaders must underwrite a regional growth pact – a Marshall Plan of sorts – that would facilitate major new investments aimed at reviving economic activity.
It is much easier to reform subsidy programs when the economy is expanding.
Moreover, building competitive markets is essential to ensuring sustainable GDP growth.
To this end, regional trade barriers, which are more pervasive in the Arab world than even in Sub-Saharan Africa, must be dismantled.
By agreeing to the pact, Arab countries would commit to reforming their subsidy systems and to reducing restrictions on cross-border economic exchange.
The regional dimension of prosperity has long been ignored in the Arab world.
But weak regional linkages limit small firms’ growth potential, forcing them to depend on state patronage.
Although Arab leaders often cite Turkey as a beacon of hope, they rarely acknowledge that the country’s recent transformation from the “sick man of Europe” to one of the world’s fastest-growing emerging markets would not have been possible had it not pursued regional synergies.
Such linkages are particularly important for Egypt and Tunisia, which will struggle to reduce unemployment unless Libya’s labor market – which has historically absorbed migrants from its North African neighbors – is reopened.
And, while Tunisia’s situation seems to be the most promising, a crippling investment shortfall is threatening to derail reform efforts there.
With Europe mired in crisis, capital flows from Tunisia’s resource-rich Arab neighbors are its best hope.
Furthermore, Arab countries must ratchet up development spending.
Given that existing development banks in the region have largely failed to act as vehicles of coordination and commitment, a new institution – resembling the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development – would have to be established to oversee a regional aid push and underwrite the costs of economic transition.
New investment vehicles, such as sovereign wealth funds and Islamic finance, can contribute financing to credit-starved firms.
At the same time, Arab countries must streamline current aid efforts.
For too long, Arab governments have simply thrown money at problems, with the rich Gulf countries effectively subsidizing their troubled neighbors’ public services.
Over the last two years, Saudi Arabia has provided more than $3 billion to Yemen. Qatar has provided &#160;$5 billion to Egypt since 2011, with a promise of $3 billion more.
And the United Arab Emirates recently pledged $2.5 billion to Bahrain.
But unconditional aid only delays reforms, because it weakens budget constraints, which reduces pressure on policymakers and creates moral hazard.
The Arab Spring has exposed fault lines that run not just through individual countries, but also through the entire region.
This calls for redefining relationships not only between citizens and states, but also among Arab countries.
Above all, it is no longer prudent to divide Arab countries between donors and recipients, or between resource-rich and resource-poor countries.
It is in the interest of the entire region – including those countries that do not seem to face an imminent threat of revolt – to contribute to their neighbors’ economic revival and facilitate their political transitions.
Atlanta &#45;&#45; The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea, air, or land. An entire population is being brutally punished.
This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel, with United States backing, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006.
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now, after internal strife, Hamas alone controls Gaza.  Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel, plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet.
Regardless of one’s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water, food, electricity, and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza, about one million of whom are refugees.
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area, causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children.
Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week, this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B’Tselem, the leading Israeli human rights organization: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn't take part in the fighting, and 25 were under 18 years of age.
On a recent trip through the Middle East, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis.
One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza.
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism, since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants.
Subsequently, I met with leaders of Hamas, both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus, Syria.
I made the same condemnation to them, and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period.
They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had refused.
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected.
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which is approximately one-fourth (28.5%) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community.
Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River, and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for “security.”
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions.
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people.
This holds promise of progress, but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis, Maryland, a retrogression has occurred in the process.
Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine, the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened.
It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations, but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly.
It is time for strong voices in Europe, the US, Israel, and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people. 
A Hundred Weltpolitiks
NEW DELHI – Mao Zedong once famously called for the Chinese to “let a hundred flowers bloom.”
Soon, however, he was recoiling from what he saw as a chaos of competing ideas.
Today, the world seems to be entering a period when, if not a hundred, at least a dozen varieties of Weltpolitik are being pursued by great and emerging powers alike.
Reconciling these competing strategic visions of the world, in particular of global crisis, will make international diplomacy more complicated than ever.
The intervention by Turkey and Brazil into the globally divisive issue of Iran’s nuclear program is but the latest, and also the clearest, sign of this new element in global affairs.
In May, the Iranian, Turkish, and Brazilian leaders met in Tehran to conclude an agreement that would supposedly have Iran deposit 1,200 kilograms of lightly enriched uranium (LEU) in Turkey, which, in exchange, would send 120 kilograms of enriched fuel to be used in Iran’s research reactor.
Russia proposed this kind of swap earlier, but Iran declined the offer, and the version agreed with Brazil and Turkey was likewise intended to forestall Iran’s ability to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU), which can be used for nuclear warheads.
But its other intention was probably to stymie American efforts to adopt new United Nations sanctions on Iran.
It is too soon to tell if Iran’s desire to obtain nuclear weapons has been delayed.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has not ruled against the agreement, and I am informed that the Brazilian/Turkish brokered deal does not violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which Iran, as a signatory, is obliged to adhere.
Nevertheless, the effort to preempt American strategy clearly failed, as new UN sanctions were implemented earlier this month.
As the deal was intended to avoid a nuclear standoff with Iran, why was there so much outrage in the US and the West?
I fear it is because the US found itself denied its primacy in setting global policy on Iran.
Instead of trying to explore the possibilities presented by the Brazilian/Turkish opening, the US quickly pushed the UN Security Council for more sanctions (the fourth round so far) on Iran.
This forced Brazil and Turkey, both currently non-permanent members of the Security Council, to vote against the sanctions resolution.
The result?
This vital vote was robbed of unanimity (Lebanon also opposed it).
The UN sanction vote was also heavily influenced by another small country with a Weltpolitik: Israel.
In February, a high-level Israeli delegation visited Beijing to present the Chinese leadership with “evidence” of Iran’s atomic ambitions.
The Israelis then explained to their hosts – in considerable detail – the potential economic consequences for China if an Israeli strike on Iran should become necessary in order to stop Iran from fulfilling its “nuclear ambitions.”
China appears to have taken the message to heart, as it voted in favor of sanctions on Iran for the first time.
Iran responded by calling China’s vote “two faced.”
The emerging stew of Weltpolitik thickened even more with Israel’s pre-emptive move in international waters to stop a flotilla supposedly bringing relief aid to blockaded Gaza.
For it was on a Turkish flagged ship that Israeli forces killed nine people, causing a near-rupture in Israeli-Turkish relations.
To be sure, this complex web of interconnected events reflects the declining global role of the US.
But it also demonstrates the robust assertion of national interest by new players on the global scene.
Brazil, Turkey, and, yes, Iran are all clearly keen to demonstrate their political and foreign-policy independence.
Brazil wants to prove that it deserves a permanent seat on the Security Council.
Turkey seeks to re-establish its Islamic identity and “Ottoman” influence over the Middle East, thereby flexing its diplomatic muscles for a European Union that has all but rejected Turkish membership.
And Iran simply wants to show once again that it will not kowtow to the “Great Satan.”
All of these motivations critically challenge US global diplomatic primacy.
But America had better get used to these types of diplomatic cat’s cradles.
For there are other powers, both emerging and established, with global foreign policies of their own – India, Indonesia, Japan.
And regional players like South Africa, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, and South Korea among others, will also have to be reckoned with in future regional disputes.
This increasingly complex web of intersecting national interests is the face of international diplomacy in the twenty-first century.
Ancient rivalries and atavistic feuds may or may not be part of this; only future crisis will tell.
But this amalgam of competing strategic visions probably marks the end of America’s post-Cold War power.
With the entire world affected by turmoil in the Persian Gulf and greater Middle East, perhaps that is all to the good. Surely, the national interests of the US and the West are not the only ones that matter.
Why, then, should the rest of the world leave the resolution of these disputes to America alone?
The era of US diplomatic hegemony has drawn to a close.
And it would be a grave mistake to think that a condominium between the US and China will impose global order in the way that the Cold War-era US/USSR superpower rivalry did.
Too many powerful countries now feel able to flex their diplomatic muscles in defense of their interests.
Mao’s hundred flowers may have bloomed only briefly, but today’s myriad species of Weltpolitik are certain to bloom perennially.
A Japanese Metamorphosis?
OSAKA – Yesterday’s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955.
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.
The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding.
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.
For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.
Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling.
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.
Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins, which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests.
Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due.
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.
So, without breaking the regular budget cycle, the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but will also be stuck with next year’s budget, which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced.
As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP’s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch.  It will also revise the supplementary budget as well.
But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen.
To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries’ top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister.
Unfortunately, the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill, which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees.
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them.
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state.
As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well.
They will most likely succeed.
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament).
Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters.
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity.
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers.
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged.
Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions.
And what of the LDP?
Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds.
Unable to pay off its constituencies, disintegration looms, for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support, but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country’s industrial sectors, occupational associations, and local communities.
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.
The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support, so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.
If the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister, as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role.
A Jobless Recovery?
CAMBRIDGE – Who will suffer the longest and the most from the implosion in 2008-2009 of Wall Street and the ensuing world recession?
Not the bankers and financiers who created the disaster.
Some financiers, like Bernard Madoff, will go to prison for fraud.
But, although Madoff was only the tip of the iceberg of rampant financial malfeasance, most suspect financiers need not fear arrest, either because their behavior merely skirted the law, or because financial impropriety more subtle than outright fraud is often difficult to prove.
Some bank bosses will retire in shame, but with huge payments to ease their pain – such as the $55 million golden parachute handed to Bank of America’s Ken Lewis, with his, and the £25 million pension bestowed on Royal Bank of Scotland’s Fred Godwin.
But, buoyed by government bailout money, guarantees, and low interest rates, many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bonuses while fighting vigorously against reforms designed to restrain their risk-taking and compensation.
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.
From 2007 to October 2009, the United States lost nearly eight million jobs, which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63% to 58.5%.
The unemployment rate at the end of 2009 was above 10%, duration of joblessness was the longest since the Great Depression, millions had had their working hours cut, and millions more were too discouraged by a lack of jobs to seek work.
Advanced Europe, Canada, and Japan also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time.
Spain, which allows for widespread temporary contracts, has had the biggest increase in unemployment, because Spanish workers can be fired as quickly as those in the US.
Some countries – for example, Germany, Sweden, and South Korea – have “hidden” their joblessness by paying firms to keep workers on the payroll. This can work in the short term, but it cannot be sustained over time.
From the 1980’s through the mid-2000’s, employment has increasingly lagged GDP in economic recoveries.
In the US, there was a jobless recovery under President Bill Clinton until the dot.com boom in the latter part of the 1990’s, and there was a jobless recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 slowdown.
In the early 1990’s, Sweden suffered a huge recession precipitated by a housing bubble and a banking crisis.
Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8% in 1990 to 9.6% in 1994, before bottoming out at 5% in 2001.
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate was 6.2% – more than triple the rate in 1990.
In 1997, Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis, but also from insistence by the US and the International Monetary Fund that it raise interest rates and undertake “Washington Consensus”-style reforms to receive aid.
Employment recovered, but primarily in “non-regular” jobs with limited benefits, low wages, and little job security.
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest (behind the US) among advanced OECD countries.
Weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being.
Young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives.
Studies of happiness show that unemployment reduces happiness by as much as the loss of a family member.
It is difficult to see the US re-attaining full employment anytime soon.
From 1993 to 1998, the US created millions of jobs, which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points.
If employment began rising at this rate in 2010, it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-recession level.
And slow recovery in the US will drag down recovery in other advanced countries, reducing their employment as well.
A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce.
From the early 1990’s on, many analysts viewed America’s weak unionization, at-will employment, limited legal job protection, and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries.
Many OECD countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along US lines.
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable.
In its 2009 Employment Outlook , the OECD took a hard look at its favored policy reforms and found them deficient in helping countries adjust to a finance-driven recession.
According to the OECD, “there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that OECD labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic downturns.”
So the lesson from the recession is clear.
The weak reed in capitalism is not the labor market, but the financial market.
At worst, labor-market failures impose modest inefficiency costs on society, whereas capital-market failures harm society greatly, with workers, rather than the perpetrators of financial disaster, suffering the most.
Moreover, globalization means that the US capital market’s failure spreads misery around the world.
We owe it to workers victimized by this recession to reinvent finance so that it works to enrich the real economy, instead of enriching only the financiers.
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector.
Since other countries’ economies and jobs are also at stake, they owe it to their citizens to press the US to deliver meaningful financial reforms.
France’s Midsummer Night’s Dream
PARIS – Bastille Day, the French national holiday, was glorious this year.
The military parade, dominated by the celebration of “victory” in Mali and the joint participation of African and United Nations troops, had the perfection of a gracious, albeit muscular, ballet.
The classical concert that preceded the magisterial fireworks that ended the day was the closest thing to a French version of the Proms in London, mixing light classical and popular songs. The Eiffel Tower imbued the evening with its magic.
Paris, in case anyone had any lingering doubts, remains the capital of the world – or so it seemed for a night.
The melancholia that began to seize France many years ago was all but forgotten.
The celebration of the glory of the past, mixed with popular English songs of the present, seemed to indicate renewed national confidence.
What was the meaning of this moment of grace?
Was it purely the product of a collective delusion, an emotional Potemkin village of sorts, encouraged, if not conceived, by the authorities to restore some level of self-assurance among France’s depressed citizens?
Even if the positive emotions remain only fleeting (as seems most likely), they were real and palpable.
The French seemed to be in the mood to celebrate.
Of course, it could simply have been the weather; a gorgeous summer has finally settled in after a miserable spring.
But it might also have been one of those natural turning points, a collective and spontaneous decision to say: “Enough of depression, let’s move on.” We French may not be what we used to be, the celebrants seemed to be saying, but we are still much more than people think we are.
We have a great revolutionary past that still conveys universal values – liberty, equality, fraternity – and an army that, as in Mali, continues to make a difference in the world.
One can draw two lessons from this collective form of escapism.
The first is that, beyond the many layers of depression and distrust in France, there is potential for a new and collective departure.
This would require, of course, less cynical political elites who can transcend their petty ambitions and divisions for the sake of the country.
The second lesson, even more obvious, is that reality cannot be changed with a simple public spectacle.
France is not Imperial Rome, where panem et circenses made a fundamental difference.
It is a weakened democracy mired in an economic and social crisis so deep that it verges on becoming an identity crisis.
The proof was provided by a third traditional event on Bastille Day, between the morning’s military parade and the evening’s music and fireworks: President François Hollande’s speech to the nation, which took the form of an interview with two prominent journalists.
He, too, was in a reassuring mood.
According to Hollande, the economic upturn – la reprise – had just started, and hope was around the corner.
His tone and message had changed.
He was no longer the “normal man” of his election campaign and tenure until now; instead, he tried to present himself, like his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, as a superhero.
Of course, given his personality and low public-approval ratings, his address was the least convincing event of the day.
Who could have said with certainty that the economic upturn announced by Hollande was real rather than aspirational?
Beyond his message’s wishful thinking, the public’s reaction to the messenger was a mixture of disbelief and indifference.
Seeing the behavior of friends, all French, listening with me to Hollande, I was reminded of another moment.
It was December 31, 1989, and I was in the Soviet Union.
I had found myself in a restaurant in the old city of Suzdal, listening to President Mikhail Gorbachev’s “New Year wishes.”
I was moved: The man who symbolized glasnost and perestroika, who had allowed the peaceful emancipation of most of Eastern and Central Europe, was speaking.
But I was alone in paying attention to him.
The restaurant’s customers, like my French friends now, could not have cared less.
Their president had become background noise.
Has Hollande become, in this sense, a French Gorbachev?
For the left and the Greens, he is close to being a traitor.
These voters chose him a year ago not only because he was not Sarkozy, but because he incarnated the values of the true left, even if his centrist moderation seemed a bad omen.
Voters of the center or even the center-right are disappointed, too, by their president’s lack of charisma, if not sheer incompetence.
After a year of Hollande, France is witnessing a fundamental political revolution.
During the half-century of the Fifth Republic, a bipartisan system of left and right has traditionally prevailed.
But now France is becoming a country dominated by a “tripartite system” of more or less equal strength: the left, the right, and the extreme right.
If France wants to capitalize on the positive emotions of Bastille Day, it needs much more responsible elites, ready to unite in the fight against unemployment and its causes (lack of competitiveness and labor-market rigidity) and consequences (the rise of populist, non-republican forces).
What Bastille Day revealed, even briefly and superficially, is that the potential to unite France exists.
But doing so requires more than shallow promises.
A Kick-Off for Peace?
Yerevan – Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan’s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic.
Given the two countries’ long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time.
But coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased.
Of course, ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey.
But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns.
In the new context set by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey’s geography and history.
Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West.
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe.
It is a NATO member, bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs.
It aspires to join the European Union, and would bring the EU to our three borders, even as we, too, aspire to join one day.
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
This year, as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel.
Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus.
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region’s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes.
If this pledge is adopted and respected, conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different, more tolerant context, marking a historic breakthrough to peace.
In fact, why not take the idea of such a pact one step further?
We in this region can, and I believe should, call for a non-aligned Caucasus, free of security blocs and adversarial alliances.
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges.
Our countries and peoples have, throughout history, lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided.
Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned.
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region’s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance.
But, at the end of the day, we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation.
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region.
In fact, real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations.
One is a lesson from history: Russia’s strategic interests here cannot be ignored.
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region.
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia’s strategic role in the region.
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul’s visit to Yerevan, real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries’ closed border – the last in Europe.
Or, for a start, the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational.
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.
President Gul’s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history, or as the beginning of a new era.
A Lasting Poison
NEW YORK – Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe’s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured.
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera’s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past.
Other examples come to mind: the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa, Romania’s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade’s fascist past, and the attacks on the alleged “Jewish monopoly of suffering” which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself.
A Bolshevik anticommunism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe.
In country after country, that Manichean mindset, with its oversimplifications and manipulations, was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power. 
Opportunism has had its share in this, of course.
In 1945, when the Red Army occupied Romania, the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members; in 1989, it had almost four million.
One day after Nicolae Ceausescu’s execution, most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades.
Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel, both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge, as the totalitarian state did, but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society.
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communistnomenklatura, untouchable in their comfortable villas and retirements, must derive great pleasure from watching today’s witch hunts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes.
But the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing.
In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old Communist, reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met – a friend of his friend’s girlfriend.
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.
Kundera’s name was contained in the investigating officer’s report, which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive.
The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, has declared that “it never happened.”
Moreover, Czechoslovakia’s fearsome secret police, who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
Until more information is forthcoming, both from Kundera and from the authorities, the case will not be solved “beyond reasonable doubt.”
Butif it happened, the case calls for a deeper reflection.
As far as we know, Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated.
Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950’s was the most brutal period of “proletarian dictatorship” in Eastern Europe – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers, fierce opponents, and apathetic bystanders alike.
Moreover, Kundera’s case is hardly unique.
In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS. Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had, in his youth, collaborated with the fascist police.
Daily life under totalitarianism, be it communist or fascist, was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding.
I don’t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes, but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody, demagogical, and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability. We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist’s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work. 
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work’s merit, yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses?
An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists, while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police.
Shouldn’t that cleaner’s drudgery to support her family, children, and her own survival be taken equally into account?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, nuanced rules toall the captives of that ordeal.
In order to understand that epoch, we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances, never simplifying a multilayered daily reality for the sake of current political goals.
If nothing else, in order to forgive, we have to know what we are forgiving.
In Eastern Europe today, old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson.
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years, until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality.
Pope Francis the Politician
BUENOS AIRES – Jorge Mario Bergoglio – not an Italian, not a European, but a Latin American from Argentina – has now been chosen as the supreme pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.
What, if anything, can Latin America expect from Pope Francis I?
For starters, it seems clear that Francis will try to assert political influence in the region, rather in the manner that Pope John Paul II used his authority in his native Poland and Central Europe in the decade leading up to the fall of communism.
A former Jesuit, Bergoglio was raised in a religious order – founded in the sixteenth century to oppose the Protestant Reformation – that is known for its power inside the church and its desire for wider political influence.
So it is no surprise that Bergoglio has always considered politics, even from a religious point of view, as central to his work.
For example, he has been very vocal in voicing discontent with the rule of Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and that of her husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner.
He was active in helping to create a coalition of opposition parties to balance the overwhelming power of Kirchnerism, which has steadily been gaining power over Argentina’s parliament, judiciary, and independent media.
Indeed, Néstor Kirchner once accused Bergoglio of being the head of the opposition coalition, and refused to attend a traditional mass – a Te Deum – because he was afraid that he would be the subject of the then-Cardinal Bergoglio’s sermon.
He memorably declared that the church belongs to everyone, and that the devil sometime wears a cassock.
Kirchner’s widow, Cristina Fernández, was clearly unhappy with the papal conclave’s choice.
When Pope Benedict XVI resigned, she shocked Argentine Catholics by joking that she would try to be a “papisa,” that is, if princesses of the church were allowed.
When Bergoglio was selected, she sent a cold, formal letter of congratulations, expressing an aloofness that was entirely inappropriate for such a historic event for Argentina.
Kirchnerismo no doubt fears Francis I. Fernández’s supporters know that Bergoglio feels closer to the United States than to any other world power.
This is not to say that they do not feel a similar closeness; but they presume that a good relationship with US President Barack Obama would help Bergoglio to wield even greater influence in Argentina and the wider region.
Bergoglio is decidedly conservative.
He opposes civil unions for gay couples, and strongly defends the church’s prohibition of abortion and its ban on women priests.
He is considered a misogynist, with views on women’s role in society identical to those propagated by the church in the Middle Ages.
At the same time, he is ascetic and sensitive to the suffering of the impoverished.
He has always had very good relations with Argentina’s trade unions; indeed, he was a Peronist in his youth.
He likes football and mate, a traditional non-alcoholic drink that one consumes by sharing with other people.
But, lacking personal charisma, none of this may be enough to establish a strong rapport with common people.
The mere fact that Francis is Latin American is bad news for the region’s populist governments – not only Argentina, but also Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Cuba.
John Paul II was one of the decisive forces in eroding the hold of communism on Europe.
If Bergoglio’s Vatican is to succeed in rolling back the populist tide that gained strength in Latin America during late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s years, he will need to establish as strong a relationship with Obama as the one that John Paul II forged with Ronald Reagan.
Still, the moment may be ripe for him to exercise such influence.
The start of his papacy finds the populist governments in a vulnerable situation, hit hard by Chávez’s recent death.
They all, of course, have their own identities and strengths, but they will miss the protection of Chávez’s global influence, as well as his subsidies.
Moreover, they rule countries in which Catholics are an overwhelming majority.
Although the degree of their religious commitment varies, they share a strong emotional attachment to the faith, which will provide Francis I with considerable political leverage.
Latin America will no doubt be one of Francis’s priorities.
But first he must reestablish the Catholic Church’s moral authority, which has been badly damaged by the scandal over numerous cases of pedophilia by priests, the Church’s attempts to cover them up,and dubious financial practices, among other problems.
Only if he succeeds on the “domestic” front will he be able to exercise political influence “abroad.”
If he fails in this task, the high expectations that he has raised after John Paul II (who addressed reports of pedophilia by dispatching them to the archives) and Benedict XVI (who was too feeble to act) will turn against him and his church.
A League of Democracies?
LONDON – Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has been calling for the creation of  a “League of Democracies.”
This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity, based partly on NATO and partly on a “new quadrilateral security partnership” in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan, and the US.
Neither Russia nor China, of course, would be invited to join: indeed, McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8.
The League is necessary, argues McCain, because in matters vital to the US, such as fighting Islamic terrorism, humanitarian intervention, and spreading liberty, democracy, and free markets,  the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations (i.e., from Russia and China).
In other words, the League’s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs.
The most damning criticism of McCain’s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies.
This is not only dangerous, but incoherent.
Russia and China do not “threaten” the “free world” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces, as they did during the Cold War.
Moreover, the world’s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur: it was France, after all, which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq.
Moreover, on issues like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, the US needs  Russian and Chinese help. Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board.
(China must learn to behave “responsibly,” McCain declares with breath-taking condescension.)  In fact, Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the “war against terrorism.”
Finally, the idea is impracticable.
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination.
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain’s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible.
Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition, to which Britain’s former prime minister, Tony Blair, often gave eloquent expression: democracies don’t fight each other, so if the whole world were democratic, wars would stop.
Presumably, McCain’s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant’s dream of perpetual peace  closer to realization by putting  pressure on non-democracies to change their ways, by force if necessary.
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it true that democracies never fight each other?
The affirmative answer  seems to depend on two separate claims.
The first is that democracies have, as a matter of historical record, never fought each other.
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II.
Moroever, they are “our kind” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems, not “Islamic democracies” like Iran.
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that “prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other.”
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies.
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity, or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy?
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945, or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm?       
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution.
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together.
Members accept the obligation not  to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council.
The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN.
But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including by the US.
By implicitly bypassing the UN, and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war.
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism. It is called trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules.
It is full of faults, which need to be corrected. But we don’t need a League of Democracies to do this.
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes, sanctions, and tests of democracy, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to retard the growth of trade, and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up.
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies – in order to spread democracy!
This is the thrust of McCain’s message. As he put it, the US was built for a purpose – to serve “eternal and universal principles.”
Its God-given task is to build an “enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom, security, prosperity, and hope.”
Noble rhetoric!
But if that is the League’s purpose – and I see no other – then it is a danger to peace.
This is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible.
This is crazy and unhistorical.
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe, which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience, to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image.
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more warlike.
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective, and one to which all the world’s major powers can sign up.
A Loan and a Prayer
NEW YORK – The countries known collectively as the PIIGS – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain – are burdened with increasingly unsustainable levels of public and private debt.   Several of the worst-hit – Portugal, Ireland, and Greece – have seen their borrowing costs soar to record highs in recent weeks, even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising.
Greece is clearly insolvent.
Even with a draconian austerity package, totaling 10% of GDP, its public debt would rise to 160% of GDP.
Portugal – where growth has been stagnant for a decade – is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency.
In Ireland and Spain, transferring the banking system’s huge losses to the government’s balance sheet – on top of already-escalating public debt – will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency.
The official approach, Plan A, has been to pretend that these economies suffer a liquidity crunch, not a solvency problem, and that the provision of bailout loans – together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms – can restore debt sustainability and market access.
This “extend and pretend” or “lend and pray” approach is bound to fail, because, unfortunately, most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to extricate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible.
For example, the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS, because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket.
The only institution that can crank up the printing press – the European Central Bank – will never resort to monetization of fiscal deficits.
Nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries.
The PIIGS’ debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible.
Moreover, whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contingent on enacting politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run – and at the cost of even more short-term pain.
To restore growth, these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency, thus turning trade deficits into surpluses.
But a rising euro – pushed higher by excessively early monetary tightening by the ECB – implies more real appreciation, further undermining competitiveness.
The German solution to this conundrum – keeping wage growth below that of productivity, thereby reducing unit labor costs – took more than a decade to yield results.
If the PIIGS started that process today, the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth.
The last option – deflation of wages and prices – to reduce costs, achieve a real depreciation, and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-deepening recession.
The real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher, making them even more unsustainable.
Lowering private and public consumption in order to boost private savings, and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts, aren’t options, either.
The private sector can spend less and save more, but this would entail an immediate cost known as Keynes’ paradox of thrift: declining economic output and rising debt as a share of GDP.
Recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes, cutting subsidies, and reducing government spending – even inefficient spending – would stifle growth in the short term, exacerbating the underlying debt problem.
If the PIIGS can’t inflate, grow, devalue, or save their way out of their problems, Plan A is either failing or is bound to fail.
The only alternative is to shift quickly to Plan B – an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries’ governments, households, and banks.
This can happen in a number of ways.
One can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS’ public debts without actually reducing the principal amount owed. This means extending the maturity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market rates.
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
For example, bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds, which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth.
In effect, these instruments turn creditors into shareholders in a country’s economy, entitling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden.
Reducing the face value of mortgages and providing the upside – in case home prices were to rise in the long run – to the creditor banks is another way to convert mortgage debt partly into shareholder equity.
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity, which would both avert a government takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis.
Europe cannot afford to continue throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring salvation.
No one will descend from the heavens, deus ex machina, to bail out the IMF or the EU.
The creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden, for the sake of the PIIGS, the EU, and their own bottom lines.
A Long March with China
BEIJING – US Vice President Joe Biden’s recent four-day visit to China ended on a high note.
He assured Chinese leaders that the United States is committed to honoring all its debts, despite its recent credit downgrade; he talked enthusiastically about US-China interdependence; and he showcased his granddaughter, who has studied Chinese for several years, as a future bridge between the two countries.
But, behind all the smiles and banquet toasts, serious issues and perception gaps continue to divide the world’s two great powers.
For starters, there is always an attitude problem.
To those who view China’s rise in a negative light, the country is simply becoming ever more arrogant.
It is getting tough in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea; it is becoming assertive in the South China Sea with its neighbors, also over disputed islands; it put its own stealth fighter on display during the US defense secretary’s visit to China; it is sending its first aircraft carrier out to sea for trials, indicating the possibility of establishing naval bases in the Indian Ocean.
Even a brawl between the Chinese and a visiting American basketball team is viewed as evidence of China’s aggressive behavior.
Many Chinese, on the other hand, tend to think that the US is suffering from severe case of conceited superpower syndrome.
As these Chinese see it, the US has a rather dysfunctional government, but nevertheless insists that its political and economic system is the best in the world, and that everyone should emulate it.
It is heavily in debt, but cannot stop spending and borrowing.
It is no longer competitive in manufacturing, but blames others for its huge trade deficit.
And the world’s only military superpower is often seen within China as trigger-happy when intervening in other countries’ internal affairs.
Then, there is the issue of trust.
China’s critics argue that its claims to a peaceful rise are not credible, given the country’s non-democratic, one-party system.
Coupled with this is a zero-sum view of the world, in which any Chinese gain in the share of the global economy, or any increased presence in many parts of the world, must be at the expense of the US or other powers.
Any Chinese military move is portrayed as an expansionary and aggressive act that must be contained.
Any attempts at engagement by Western politicians, such as Biden’s recent trip, are automatically met with doubt and criticism for cozying up to dictators.
Likewise, for those Chinese who are suspicious of US intentions, conspiracy is always in play.
They see a declining superpower using economic, military, and diplomatic means in an unrelenting effort to prevent China’s rise.
Talk of human rights and democracy is nothing but a smoke screen for demonizing China.
Arms sales to Taiwan, Tibetan activism, and “color revolutions” of various kinds are all sponsored by the US and other Western powers, and are aimed at weakening China.
Despite decades of close interaction, with millions of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese visiting China every year and similar numbers of Chinese now visiting the US and other advanced countries, both sides see each other through a glass darkly.
Increased interdependence has not led to better understandings on even some of the most basic issues.
China’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Fu Ying expressed her country’s anxiety about this state of affairs in a recent interview. “The most important thing is the question of whether China and the US are enemies.
Are we going to be in a war?
Are we preparing for a war against each other?” Biden, while reaffirming that the US does not view China as an enemy, implied that Fu’s worries are not fanciful, saying that the worst scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict.
So the key issue for China, its neighbors, the US, and rest of the world is not how many aircraft carriers, missiles, submarines, and next-generation fighters China may produce and deploy in the coming years and decades.
Rather, it is how China intends to use its newly acquired economic and military strength in pursuing its domestic and foreign-policy goals – and how the world’s leading powers can ensure that they do not end up harming each other by accident or misunderstanding.
To meet these challenges successfully, there is no viable alternative to a positive, continuous, and frank engagement between China and the rest of the world.
The Chinese economy will continue to grow; the Chinese military will continue to modernize; and the Chinese people will remain united in their Great Power aspirations.
A Cold War-style confrontation and containment policy from the West will be met with strong resistance from the Chinese, whose global leverage, particularly in finance, cannot be ignored.
Only a patient, creative, and consistent engagement strategy will mitigate fears on both sides.
China’s rise is a fact; the enduring peacefulness of that rise must be a priority for China, its neighbors, the West, and, most importantly, the US.
A Looming Anti-Depressants Crisis
The widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly, right back to the days of opiates and cocaine, up through bromides, barbiturates, and tranquilizers: all proved to be highly addictive drugs, but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so.
Now anti-depressants--global brands with household names--are the problem.
The past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions.
In England, prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979.
It is now clear that today's anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being.
The sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects: substantial weight gain, loss of libido, and mood changes, to name just the most common complaints.
Suspicions about such problems--especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression--have been rumbling for years, but searching scientific investigations have only just begun.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom's drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings.
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug's use.
This may help, it but won't address the real issue: how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience, and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves?
On the Richter scale of drug disasters, the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11, where thalidomide rates a 10.
Time will tell, but the key point is this: the thalidomide disaster of the 1950's and 1960's happened because there was no independent control of drug safety, whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under theaegisof an elaborate, expensive, and global regulatory system.
The nub of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm, but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain.
If and when this crisis is ever properly investigated, it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms, as expose questions about what medicine is and should be.
These underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come.
The explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering, presenting, and communicating evidence.
It broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants, giving patients a collective voice, as never before.
Previously, drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients' reaction to medicines.
But this crisis revealed these reports' fundamental inadequacies, such that users' experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again.
United by the Internet, many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels' warnings.
The impact of this user intelligence has been profound: in 2003, one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2% to 25% (even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is "not habit forming" at all).
The anti-depressant crisis provides, for the first time, dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk.
To be sure, user reports are not "scientific" and most, individually, might seem naïve, confused, exaggerated, mistaken, and/or just plain self-absorbed.
Yet in this case they provided, collectively, more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials.
So, now the question is not so much the value of patients' reports, but the integrity of medical research and the state of science.
"Just how tainted has clinical medicine become," asked an editorial in the British medical journalThe Lancet in 2002; the answer was "heavily and damagingly so."
The duplicity surrounding the marketing of anti-depressant drugs underscores just how corrupt the profession has become.
The crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science, the relationship between risk and benefit, and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health.
But one feature above all others captures the underlying problem: the yawning gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the terminology of producers, experts, and authorities who mince words.
The 1990's saw "depression" formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions--a convenient and seductive view, but deeply simplistic.
The term "drug dependence" was also redefined, to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting.
The ubiquitous term "discontinuation symptoms"--Orwelliannewspeak for withdrawal--implied that anti-depressants carried no risk of dependence.
On the contrary, wishful thinking led experts to adduce "discontinuation symptoms" as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies.
Later, suicides became routinely described as "non-accidental overdoses," and the broad-spectrum term "emotional lability" came into vogue, despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears.
By contrast, user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality, rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved.
In the long run, the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise, but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve.
A Man against the Machine
WASHINGTON, DC ­– America’s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength, that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table.
If we are still making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators.
Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector.
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients: arguments that persuade, the ability to bring colleagues along, and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time.
On two fronts, Kaufman has – against long odds – actually managed to make substantial steps.
Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex, effectively at the heart of Wall Street.
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction – major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government – and by New York’s state attorney general – into the US financial sector’s residential lending and related securities practices.
With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud.
More recently, Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony, evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman, was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual, Goldman, and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies.
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading, which is little understood by America’s main financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and poses systemic market risk.
His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6, when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function: price discovery between buyers and sellers.
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms, interacting across more than 50 market centers, caused this catastrophe.
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “financial innovation.”
Kaufman’s approach – with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature – seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago.
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns – preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people get it.
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged, “The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all... I’ve been proud to follow his lead.”
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency.
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership.
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs – trades by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders.
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster; to be sure, they and many others are now listening.
On a third issue, the results so far are mixed.
Kaufman championed the case for making America’s biggest banks smaller, as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts.
His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment, co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown, that would have imposed a hard cap on banks’ size and leverage (debt relative to assets).
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable, yet it went down to defeat, 33-61, also on May 6.
It might have gained more support just a few days later – after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks.
Still, it has strengthened backing for another amendment, sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin, which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account – coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and “dark” part of high-speed trading.
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman’s critique of our system is the need for tough laws.
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing.
In particular, regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque, and when powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem.
Unfortunately, despite his newfound prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden’s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election.
When he goes, dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.
Let’s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector.
Kaufman’s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident: relying on deregulation and self-interest in today’s complex, opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth.
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets.
A Mania for Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder
PROVIDENCE, RI – During the past few years, many experts have suggested that bipolar disorder – a serious illness resulting in significant psychosocial morbidity and excess mortality – is under-recognized, particularly in patients with major depression.
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made.
The clinical implications of the failure to recognize bipolar disorder in depressed patients include the under-prescription of mood-stabilizing medications, and an increased risk of rapid “cycling” – swings between manic and depressive phases.
But, perhaps as a consequence of concerted efforts to improve the recognition of bipolar disorder, during the past few years we have observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon – over-diagnosis.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In my own practice, my colleagues and I have encountered patients who reported that they were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, despite lacking a history of manic or hypomanic episodes.
To be sure, we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression who really did have bipolar disorder.
However, there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis.
We therefore conducted a study to examine empirically how often bipolar disorder might be over- and under-diagnosed.
Seven hundred psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked whether they had been previously diagnosed by a health-care professional with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder.
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives.
Slightly more than 20% (145 patients) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, significantly higher than the 12.9% rate based on the SCID. Less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID.
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID.
Patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID did not have a significantly higher risk for bipolar disorder than the patients who were negative for bipolar disorder by self-report and the SCID.
Our findings, validated by family history, thus suggest that bipolar disorder was over-diagnosed.
Any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview.
Such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis.
The question, then, is not whethersome patients previously given a diagnosis do not seem to have it upon re-interview, but ratherhow many.
How high the percentage should be before claiming over-diagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment.
But we think that an over-diagnosis rate of more than 50% crosses the clinical significance threshold.
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder has costs.
Mood stabilizers are the treatment of choice, and, depending on the medication, they can produce potentially significant health complications affecting renal, endocrine, hepatic, immunologic, or metabolic function.
Thus, over-diagnosing bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side-effects of medication.
The impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and publicity probably plays a role in the emerging tendency to over-diagnose bipolar disorder.
Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder.
We have seen evidence of this in our practice.
This does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening questionnaire, but rather how these scales are used.
Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity, at a cost of false positives, because it is presumed that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation.
But insufficient diagnostic rigor can result in over-diagnosis.
Clinicians are inclined to diagnose disorders that they feel more comfortable treating.
We believe that the increased availability of medications that have been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder might be influencing clinicians who are unsure whether or not a patient has bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder to err on the side of diagnosing the disorder that is responsive to medication.
This bias is reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physicians, which has emphasized research on delayed diagnosis and under-recognition of bipolar disorder, possibly sensitizing clinicians accordingly.
The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious, agitated, and/or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and “racing thoughts” being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder.
The results of our study are consistent with prior studies suggesting possible problems with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder, along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis, it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis.
Both can have negative consequences.
While there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach, we recommend that clinicians use a standardized, validated method.
A Marshall Plan for the Arab World
ROME – US President Barack Obama’s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe.
Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective, as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe’s division, can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings.
The crisis in Europe’s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region, for Europe, and for the world.
The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe’s peace, stability, and economic growth.
The continent’s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner.
And events there, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the United States.
Current events, not just in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain, mirror the political complexity of these countries.
They also spring from different factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, coupled with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequalities, and job creation.
Europe’s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition.
Proposals for some sort of “partnership for transformation,” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, should bear in mind that the region’s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months.
No surprise, then, that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans.
Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism, and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated.
Given this, the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region’s security.
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe’s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability, the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs.
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia – and possibly a peaceful Libya – to strengthen their political stability through democratization.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace.
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage.
The broad planks of a partnership are already there, so what is now needed is to enhance Europe’s integration with its southern neighbors.
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU “Plan for the Mediterranean” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources.
The Union for the Mediterranean, launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services.
Let us, together with the US, tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies.
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU’s internal market and participate in EU programs.
To achieve all of this, a clear set of principles is required.
We Europeans must favor stability, create a real spirit of co-ownership, and promote political responsibility.In this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially during the transition period.
Europe’s strong support for the region’s economic development must remain the top priority, as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms.
Moreover, a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task.
One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank’s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), which would become an autonomous institution, perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa, with shares held by the region’s governments (or other institutions) and other willing parties.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region, which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises.
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe; there’s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean.
At the same time, the EU must launch a “dialogue among equals” on political and security matters, aimed at confidence-building across the region.
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (CSCM) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability.
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of “mare nostrum.”
They are part of our collective history, and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build.
A Middle Eastern Union?
TOLEDO, SPAIN – This autumn, the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East.
One conclusion that emerged was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional.
With this idea in mind, Munther Haddadin, a former Jordanian minister of water resources, proposed for the Middle East a “Water and Energy Union,” a long-term mechanism to integrate a fragmented region.
The idea is compelling.
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that, over the past month, Joschka Fischer, Germany’s former foreign minister, has called for such a union.
So, too, have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water.
Having convened the meeting in Spain, we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal.
But the European “coal and steel union” became possible only after Europe’s major political conflicts were resolved.
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work.
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end.
And past injustices will need to be put aside, so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems.
Here, the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging.
During the 1990’s, the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development, the environment, refugees, arms control, and water.
It failed, because when the bilateral talks collapsed, readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada.
The necessary political framework also needs to be regional and, fortunately, it exists.
The Arab Peace Initiative, first tabled at an Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002 and reconfirmed in Riyadh in 2007, provides all the parties with a framework to resolve their differences, as well as a political basis for moving forward.
Adopting it is essential to moving forward, especially if additional chapters addressing regional security and economic relations are included.
Despite today’s chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union, coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative, would change mindsets.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region’s water and energy needs can be met; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal.
Moreover, the arid triangle formed by Israel, Palestine, and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution.
A World Bank report has already stated that, with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020, water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable.
Coincidentally, over the past month, there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach.
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region, accompanied by an economic package, since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration.
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation.
The problems are too complex, and the dangers of radicalism too advanced, to permit success through haphazard means.
The Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region’s peoples and mitigate future conflict.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence.
It can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern – water, energy, and politics.
A Modest Proposal for the G-20
BEIJING – In March, at a meeting in Beijing organized by Columbia University’s Initiative for Policy Dialogue and China’s Central University of Finance and Economics, scholars and policymakers discussed how to reform the international monetary system.
After all, even if the system did not directly cause the recent imbalances and instability in the global economy, it proved ineffective in addressing them.
Reform will, of course, require extensive discussion and deliberation.
But the consensus in Beijing was that the G-20 should adopt a modest proposal this year: a limited expansion of the International Monetary Fund’s current system of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
This proposal, while limited in scope, could play an important role in initiating discussion of deeper reforms while helping to restore the fragile world economy to health and achieve the aim expressed in the G-20’s Pittsburgh declaration: strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.
We suggest that SDRs’ role be expanded through new issues and by increasing their use in IMF lending.
Doing so would build on the enlightened suggestion made at the G-20’s London meeting in April 2009 to issue SDRs equivalent to $250 billion, which was then quickly implemented.
The G-20 could suggest that the IMF issue a significant volume of SDRs over the next three years.
We would suggest, for example, an issue of SDR150-250 billion annually (approximately $240-390 billion at current exchange rates).
Such a measure would have several positive effects.
First, it would reduce the recessionary bias in the world economy, especially during crises and in their aftermath.
Many countries continue to accumulate high levels of precautionary reserves, especially to avoid future crises stemming from reversals on their capital and trade accounts.
Recent financial crises have taught countries that those with large reserves are better able to weather the vicissitudes of international financial markets.
While such reserve accumulations help protect countries, in certain periods they reduce global aggregate demand.
Given its relatively small scale, the annual issue of SDRs would only partly offset these deficiencies, but it would nonetheless help sustain and accelerate global recovery without causing inflationary pressure.
Moreover, reducing the need for countries to set aside funds for reserves would also facilitate some reduction of global imbalances.
Ideally, additional issuance of SDRs would be accompanied by further measures to increase their effectiveness.
For example, countries’ unused SDRs could be held as “deposits” by the IMF, which the Fund could then use to finance its lending programs.
This should be understood as the first step toward integrating “general resource” and “SDR” accounts into a single IMF account, and to increase the SDR’s role in IMF transactions so that it eventually becomes the main – or even only – mechanism for IMF financing.
During a declared crisis, IMF lending should be financed entirely by new SDR issues in unlimited amounts.
A working group could be established to study other reforms that would enhance global financial stability further and address other global economic and financial objectives.
For example, alternative systems of SDR allocation, with a greater proportion of SDRs given to countries actually demanding the reserves (mainly developing countries), might contribute to global growth and stability.
One advantage of this modest proposal is that it would not prejudice the outcomes of the working group on broader reforms, like new distribution formulas for SDRs.
The issuance of additional SDRs, while contributing to global stability today, would not alter in any fundamental way existing monetary arrangements.
We suggest that this proposal be discussed at forthcoming meetings of the G20.
The G-20 showed its effectiveness in responding to the crisis that erupted in 2008.
The question today is whether, with the moment of crisis passing and countries’ circumstances and perspectives diverging, the G-20 can demonstrate the leadership the world needs in addressing its ongoing critical problems.
A failure to take concrete action would risk breeding disillusionment.
Our proposal would reaffirm the G-20’s continued leadership in ensuring greater stability and sustained growth in the world economy.
A More Perfect Monetary Union
WARSAW – The eurozone is often considered an experiment – a monetary union without political unification.
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state, which possesses two relevant features: limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers.
Those who claim that “political union” is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature, despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states.
In this sense, they ignore the fact that the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union, not its substitute.
Indeed, the eurozone’s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget, but from weak enforcement of the Pact.
More fundamentally, monetary unions – in a broader sense – have existed not only within single states, but also in groups of sovereign states, the gold standard being the most notable example in history. The experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons.
First, they required fiscal discipline in the member states, which was true under the gold standard, with its informal norm of balanced budgets. Second, they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center, because such a center did not exist.
Instead, a great deal of flexibility, including within their labor markets, facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks.
It is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption.
This would require an enhanced level of European identity, something which the Union’s political elites cannot generate artificially. &#160;But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve, but rather that it would not address the main problem: the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states.
Instead of looking at the wrong model – that of a single state – the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks.
First, utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks.
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt, with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles, which cause deep recessions – and thus sharp increases in budget deficits – when they burst.
Likewise, the European Central Bank’s monetary policy should “lean against the wind” by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles.
As the ECB’s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries, the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth.
Meanwhile, the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced, which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions.
To be sure, initiatives at the EU and/or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states, which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics.
But EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states, and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries, which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone – and within the EU.
Second, beyond strengthening economic institutions, EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks.
The former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt, while the latter would help them to address unemployment.
Of the many necessary measures in this area, the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market, coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs.
Moreover, the Lisbon Agenda should be reinvigorated, with a focus on market reforms, and the EU should urgently reconsider measures – particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy – that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and/or hamper the flexibility of markets.
In this respect, the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important.
As EU members already have large tax burdens, further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth.
Thus, fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments, which –given the aging of EU societies – must include raising the retirement age.
Finally, rigid labor markets and, more generally, regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy, deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks, and contribute to the growth of unemployment.
Therefore, labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon Agenda.
European elites are fond of exclamations about “European solidarity,” “social cohesion,” and the “European social model.”
But no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here – or obviate the need for them.
Hardening Brazil’s Soft Power
BRASILIA – It is, perhaps, a truism for Brazil’s citizens that their country is and always will be a peaceful one.
After all, Brazil has lived with its ten neighbors without conflict for almost 150 years, having settled its borders through negotiation.
It last went to war in 1942, after direct aggression by Nazi U-boats in the South Atlantic.
It has forsworn nuclear weapons, having signed a comprehensive nuclear-safeguards agreement with Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Through the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), Brazil is helping to integrate the region politically, economically, socially, and culturally.
But is soft power enough for one of the world’s major emerging countries?
To be sure, Brazil’s peaceful foreign policy has served it well.
Brazil has used its stature to advance peace and cooperation in South America and beyond.
Its constructive stance derives from a worldview that accords pride of place to the values of democracy, social justice, economic development, and environmental protection.
Brazil’s unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power, reflected in the broad international support that placed Brazilians atop international institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization.
Yet no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests.
Indeed, in an unpredictable world, where old threats are compounded by new challenges, policymakers cannot disregard hard power.
By deterring threats to national sovereignty, military power supports peace; and, in Brazil’s case, it underpins our country’s constructive role in the pursuit of global stability.
That role is more necessary than ever.
Over the past two decades, unilateral actions in disregard of the UN Security Council’s primary responsibility in matters of war and peace have led to greater uncertainty and instability.
Likewise, little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made, in disregard of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Brazil’s abundance of energy, food, water, and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to, or control of, natural resources.
In order to meet the challenges of this complex reality, Brazil’s peaceful foreign policy must be supported by a robust defense policy.
Brazil’s National Defense Strategy, updated in 2012, states that the modernization of the Armed Forces is intrinsically linked to national development.
Thus, it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry.
In accordance with the Strategy, Brazil is enhancing its conventional deterrence capabilities, including by building a nuclear-propelled submarine as part of a naval program commensurate with its responsibilities in the South Atlantic.
Brazil coordinates closely on defense matters with its neighbors, both bilaterally and through Unasur’s South American Defense Council, which aims to promote confidence-building, transparency, a joint regional defense industry, and, most important, a common defense identity.
One potential mechanism for advancing these objectives is a South American Defense College, now under consideration.
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable – what the political scientist Karl Deutsch once called a “security community.”
Having visited every South American country in my tenure as Defense Minister, I am convinced that, the most effective deterrent on the continent is cooperation.
At the same time, Brazil is pursuing increased bilateral defense cooperation with African partners.
With our neighbors on both shores of the South Atlantic, Brazil is working closely to strengthen the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic (ZPCSA), which aims to keep the ocean free from rivalries foreign to it and from nuclear weapons.
Brazil is also reaching out to other emerging countries, such as its fellow BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and members of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (India, Brazil, and South Africa).
For example, Brazil conducts IBSAMAR, a regular trilateral naval exercise, with South Africa and India.
More broadly, we are exploring ways to cooperate in the joint development of defense technologies.
Through such endeavors, Brazil hopes to contribute to a more balanced international order, one less subject to hegemonies of any kind, without losing sight of the importance of mutually beneficial partnerships with developed countries.
Even as Brazil hardens its soft power, it remains deeply committed to the path of dialogue, conflict prevention, and the negotiated settlement of disputes.
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries like Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil’s contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide.
In the twenty-first century, a truly stable global order will depend on a legitimate and effective UN Security Council, one that reflects the plurality of the emerging multipolar world.
China Grows Down
HONG KONG – For more than three decades, China’s GDP has grown by an average of more than 10% annually.
But former Premier Wen Jiabao rightly described this impressive growth performance as “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable,” highlighting the many economic, social, and environmental costs and challenges that have accompanied it.
Now China must choose between the export-based, investment-driven growth model of the past and a new, more viable economic order.
Cheap credit and perverse incentives – such as promotions for officials who contribute most to GDP growth – have led to massive but redundant investment, which, in turn, has contributed to excess capacity in manufacturing and infrastructure.
This model is not only inefficient; channeling government resources to support investment also undermines China’s social development.
Given this, China’s leaders have decided to stop using GDP growth as the primary criterion for evaluating officials’ performance.
Indeed, the 12th Five-Year Plan, which extends until 2015, aims to shift China’s economy to a new, more sustainable growth model based on quality and innovation, and accepts that annual GDP growth will likely fall to 7% during the transition.
Most discussion of growth models nowadays is based on work by the Nobel laureate Robert Solow.
For Solow, GDP growth is determined by the factor inputs of land, labor, and capital, together with the economy’s total factor productivity (TFP, or the change in output not accounted for by changes in the volume of inputs, but by factors like technological innovation and institutional reform).
Since 1978, China, by implementing major reforms, has achieved three periods of high TFP growth, each lasting 5-7 years.
First, in the early 1980’s, following the introduction of the rural household-responsibility system, which boosted agricultural productivity and released a large amount of unskilled labor to work in the higher-productivity urban and industrial sectors, annual TFP growth accelerated to 3-4%.
The second such period followed Deng Xiaoping’s southern tour in 1992, during which he emphasized the need to shift to a market-based – albeit state-controlled – system by opening China’s economy to foreign direct investment and establishing special economic zones to help develop export-oriented industries.
This time, TFP growth soared to 5-6%, partly owing to the “catching up” process facilitated by China’s adoption of foreign technology and know-how.
Finally, after major reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the tax system, China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001.
With the country fully integrated into global supply chains, TFP growth hit 4%, where it remained until 2007.
Since then, however, the TFP growth rate has fallen by almost half.
Indeed, China’s economy has experienced a significant – and ongoing – growth slowdown in the wake of the global economic crisis that erupted five years ago.
By 2012, human capital’s contribution to China’s GDP growth fell almost to zero, with fixed-capital accumulation accounting for roughly 60% of total growth.
Large-scale, debt-funded capital investments have raised the country’s credit/GDP ratio to nearly 200%, increasing the financial system’s vulnerability – a development reflected in the recent spike in interbank interest rates.
In order to achieve more balanced and sustainable GDP growth, China’s leaders must implement a set of deep, comprehensive, and long-lasting institutional reforms aimed at boosting TFP.
In particular, the reforms should be designed to facilitate China’s transition from its traditional supply-based growth model, which assumes that building hard infrastructure leads automatically to demand growth.
In fact, GDP growth may be slowing precisely because existing investment in manufacturing and infrastructure, undertaken largely by local governments and SOEs, does not match the pattern of domestic demand.
As a result, China now faces the problem of short-term excess capacity.
Improving the quality of GDP growth will depend on Chinese leaders’ willingness to enact market-oriented reforms.
Rather than directly driving investment, the state must emphasize its regulatory and enforcement functions, including setting and overseeing standards, building an effective property-rights infrastructure, and managing macroeconomic conditions.
At the same time, the state must improve the quality and delivery of education, health care, and security, while minimizing corruption and administrative abuses.
In short, China must shift its focus from meeting GDP growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition, thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively.
The state would thus become an intermediary agent, facilitating the development of a sustainable economic order in which less is more – that is, a system in which less intervention creates more opportunities for creativity.
SOEs undoubtedly played an important role in China’s previous growth model, delivering the infrastructure and services that were deemed necessary for the global manufacturing supply chain to function.
But access to cheap credit from state-controlled banks creates an incentive for SOEs to generate surplus capacity, which increases systemic risk in the economy.
To correct China’s excess-capacity problem would require the relevant enterprises, whether SOEs or private firms, to exit the market.
Unless China’s leaders implement major structural reforms aimed at establishing a market-based growth model, they will be unable to avoid the “middle-income trap” that has prevented so many developing economies from attaining advanced-country status.
The deceleration in GDP growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamism and overall economic stability.
A Murder in Moscow
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin’s “dictatorship of law” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia’s bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe.
Germany’s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense ofdéjà vu: just as in the KGB’s heyday, people simply disappear in Putin’s Russia.
Politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.
The fact that Russia’s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya’s killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn’t inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya’s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia’s President.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow,Novaya Gazeta, and in her books “Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” and “A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya,” Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin’s presidency.
As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin’s enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin’s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.
Putin’s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin’s “dictatorship of law” was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.
On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin’s Kremlin cabal.
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.
The danger for the world is that Putin’s lawlessness is being exported.
Across Russia’s near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Look at Putin’s attempt to rig Ukraine’s previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin’s backing.
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maximqui tacet consenterevidetur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower.
A Nation of Vidiots
NEW YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world.
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set: DVDs, computers, game boxes, smart phones, and more.
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects.
The United States led the world into the television age, and the implications can be seen most directly in America’s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called “the glass teat.” In 1950, fewer than 8% of American households owned a TV; by 1960, 90% had one.
That level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere, and the poorest countries are still not there.
True to form, Americans became the greatest TV watchers, which is probably still true today, even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete.
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount, given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours.
In Scandinavia, for example, time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average.
The consequences for American society are profound, troubling, and a warning to the world – though it probably comes far too late to be heeded.
First, heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure.
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse.
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do.
Moreover, heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation.
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen.
Robert Putnam, the leading scholar of America’s declining sense of community, has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “social capital,” the trust that binds communities together.
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.
Of course, many other factors are at work, but television-driven social atomization should not be understated.
Certainly, heavy TV viewing is bad for one’s physical and mental health.
Americans lead the world in obesity, with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight.
Again, many factors underlie this, including a diet of cheap, unhealthy fried foods, but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well.
At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically.
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.
America’s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands, and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising.
Effective advertising campaigns, appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food, sex, and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
The same, of course, has happened to politics.
American politicians are now brand names, packaged like breakfast cereal.
Anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle.
All roads to power in America lead through TV, and all access to TV depends on big money.
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before.
Even war can be rolled out as a new product.
The Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war – Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction –in the familiar colorful, fast-paced, and graphics-heavy style of television advertising.
Then the war itself began with the so-called “shock and awe” bombing of Baghdad – a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion.
Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda.
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development, and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media.
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox, but one that is perfectly understandable.
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households, but are also more likely to have a television in their room.
When a commodity’s consumption falls as income rises, economists call it an “inferior” good.
To be sure, the mass media can be useful as a provider of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid.
At the very least, we can minimize those dangers.
Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising, especially to young children; non-commercial, publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC; and free (but limited) TV time for political campaigns.
Of course, the best defense is our own self-control.
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading, talking with each other, and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust.
A Neighborly Option for Iran
YEREVAN – Once again, the issue of bombing or sanctioning Iran has resurfaced.
For years, debate about Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives.
Some are convinced that a nuclear Iran is the worst of all possible scenarios, worse even than the fall-out from a pre-emptive strike.
But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are wise options, certainly not for this region. 
The repercussions of bombing Iran should be clear: closure of the Straits of Hormuz, skyrocketing oil prices, possible retaliation against Israel (regardless of the origin of the attack), and even greater turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Indeed, the only certainty of any pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-lasting damage to regional security and political and economic stability.
Of course, the alternative is no safer.
A nuclear-armed Iran would change the entire region’s security environment, and, given the enmity between Israel and Iran, two such nuclear powers facing off against each other would pose a threat.
The way out of this dilemma is to understand what Iran wants – and how to accommodate it without jeopardizing anyone’s security.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use.
Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so.
But the world is split over whether to believe that Iran is actually doing what it says.
If as some argue Iran is being disingenuous, then once it achieves this first phase – uranium enrichment for industrial purposes – it can easily slide into weapons-grade enrichment, leaving the international community out in the cold, with no channels of communication, no observation teams in place, and no monitors ready to sound the whistle.
That is why the world must not remain focused on the already-lost first phase.
Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges despite all the international sanctions and threats.
Instead, the world must focus on the second phase, because it is weapons potential that is the looming danger, and it is here that internationally mandated mechanisms for oversight and supervision exist.
The Iranians have always said that they will continue to honor their commitments and open their doors to observation as members of the non-proliferation community.
But the international community must be more respectful of Iran’s current industrial aims if it wants Iranian cooperation.
The first step is to assuage Iran’s feeling of being besieged.
Fortunately, there are voices in America and elsewhere that advocate engaging Iran at the highest level.
But, to talk with Iran effectively, one must understand Iranian values and thinking.
Iranians have a sense of seniority, if not superiority, born of a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times.
But they also have a historically ingrained sense of insecurity, owing to frequent conquest and domination, which is being aggravated today by the presence of American troops to their west in Iraq and to their east in Afghanistan.
Their outlook nowadays is the product of these two worldviews – suspicious of others’ motives and proud of themselves as smart, tough negotiators and not without their own resources.
In my meetings with the current and past leaders of Syria and Iran, as well as in my meeting with Saddam Hussein, I heard them all say the same thing: the West is out to get them.
Their explanation was that the West is uncomfortable with the motives and behavior of ideological states – Syria, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam were states with causes – Islam, Arab unity, or anti-Zionism.
For Iranians, as bearers of faith and national pride, responses that seem to others self-righteous and irrational are, in fact, necessary and acceptable.
The case of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of a willingness to go to hell with your head held high.
Saddam knew that he didn’t have weapons of mass destruction, but he was unwilling to concede the right of inspectors to ask. 
As in North Korea, Iran’s neighbors might provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world.
In the so-called “six-party talks,” North Korea’s neighbors offered tangible incentives to Kim Jong-il’s regime to abandon its nuclear program.  The most prominent of these was an end to North Korea’s economic isolation.
Iran, too, feels besieged, though it is not isolated: it depends heavily on trade, and not just as a seller of oil.
Two-thirds of its population is under the age of 30, and unemployment is high; it needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry, and to finance road construction and other infrastructure projects.
Comparisons with neighboring Turkey are instructive.
Before Iran’s Islamic revolution, it led Turkey in foreign direct investment, income per head, and GDP growth.
Now Turkey has moved ahead, and may even join the European Union.
Other regional comparisons further reinforce that trend.
The Qataris have outstripped them in exploiting the huge gas field they share.
Tiny Dubai draws in far more foreign investment: Iranians go there for banking, trade, and fun.
Iran’s neighbors need to convince Iran’s rulers that Iranians, too, can participate in the region’s growth, and even become regional leaders.
Only an open Iran, fully integrated into the regional economy and granted a role commensurate to its size and economic potential, will be able to moderate its siege mentality.
Here, a vital step would be for the West to begin to envisage Iran as a potential alternative supplier of gas, by offering to link Iran to the proposed White Stream and Nabucco pipelines that are currently under development to bring Central Asian gas to Europe.
The world’s judgments about Iran’s motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride.
We can only understand Iran’s real intentions by engaging the Iranians – not cornering them.
A New Approach to North Korea
SEOUL – The long-delayed meeting of North Korea’s ruling Worker’s Party is now underway, and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community.
It is widely expected that Kim Jong-il’s third son, Kim Jong-eun, will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father’s successor.
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place, allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base.
Whatever happens, and whoever turns out to be the new leader, North Korea most likely faces an unstable future.
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system’s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges.
Moreover, responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang.
North Korea’s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the Worker’s Party conference, held for the first time in three decades, was abruptly postponed earlier in September.
One cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite, a group that “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before.
Moreover, Kim’s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess, further complicating matters.
“Enough is enough,” a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun’s likely succession.
Ordinary North Koreans, too, evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il’s inheritance of power from his father, Kim Il-sung.
Moreover, there is no hope that any new leader, whoever it may be, will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control, given the economy’s utter state of decay, as last year’s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated.
The regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society, and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation.
For example, for the first time, North Korea’s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error – the failure of the currency redenomination.
For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea’s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally.
One troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance.
And, at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation, North Korea’s leaders, their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons, might try to distract their public through audacious, and possibly destructive, acts abroad.
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come.
Indeed, the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime’s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture – the latter being the authorities’ fearful response to the former.
Unfortunately, however, most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease.
Of course, in order to pressure North Korea’s government to give up its nuclear option, the current international economic sanctions, which target WMD-related products and luxury goods, probably should continue.
But, at the same time, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform.
At a time of increased tension between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake.
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed.
If, say, North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior, it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund.
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy.
Of course, any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes.
The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime’s will to reform.
In fact, following the recent currency fiasco, North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before.
Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy, which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform.
To be sure, North Korea’s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement.
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered.
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea’s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform.
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously.
On the contrary, it may be impossible to win North Korea’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change.  
The past two decades have shown that “politically correct” decisions do not produce the “right” results, even in the long run.
As North Korea grooms a new leader, the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea.
A New Asian Security Constellation
NEW DELHI – Leading members of the governments of India and South Korea recently met to begin a new “strategic partnership.”
They are not alone in doing so, for across Asia, a new security architecture is being constructed, seemingly piecemeal.
How Asia’s geopolitical landscape will evolve over the coming decades is not easy to foresee.
But it is apparent that an increasingly assertive China is unwittingly reinforcing America’s role in Asia, restoring US primacy as the implicit guarantor of security and stability in the region.
There are at least four possible Asian security scenarios for the years and decades ahead.
The first is the rise of a Sino-centric Asia.
China seeks a multipolar world but a unipolar Asia.
By contrast, the US desires a unipolar world but a multipolar Asia.
A second scenario is that the US remains Asia’s principal security anchor, with or without a third possibility: the emergence of a constellation of Asian states with common interests working together to ensure that Asia is not unipolar. Finally, Asia could come to be characterized by several resurgent powers, including Japan, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and a reunified Korea.
Of the four scenarios, the first has caused the greatest unease.
China’s neighbors are increasingly anxious about its growing power and assertiveness.
While China’s rulers aspire to shape a Sino-centric Asia, their efforts to intimidate smaller neighbors hardly make China a credible candidate for Asian leadership.
After all, genuine leadership cannot come from raw power, but only from other states’ consent or tacit acceptance.
If leadership could be built on brute force, schoolyard bullies would be class presidents.
In any event, China’s power may be vast and rapidly growing, but it lacks the ability to compel.
In other words, China does not have the capability to rout any rival militarily, let alone enforce its will on Asia.
That fact has, however, done little to allay fears in the region.
With its defense spending having grown almost twice as fast as its GDP, China is now beginning to take the gloves off, confident that it has acquired the necessary muscle.
For example, China now includes the South China Sea in its “core” national interests, on a par with Taiwan and Tibet, in order to stake a virtually exclusive claim to military operations there.
China also has increasingly questioned India’s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, the northeastern Indian state that China’s rulers call “Southern Tibet” and claim largely as their own.
Indian defense officials have reported a rising number of Chinese military incursions across the 4,057-kilometer Himalayan border.
As China seeks to translate its economic clout into major geopolitical advantages in Asia, a country that once boasted of “having friends everywhere” finds that its growing power may be inspiring awe, but that its actions are spurring new concerns and fears.
Which states will accept China as Asia’s leader? Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.
Leadership entails more than the possession of enormous economic and military power.
It demands the power of ideas that can galvanize others.
Such power also serves as the moral veneer to the assertiveness often involved in the pursuit of any particular cause or interest.
The US and its allies won the Cold War, for example, not so much by military means as by spreading the ideas of political freedom and market capitalism to other regions.
In the words of the strategic analyst Stanley A. Weiss, this “helped suck the lifeblood out of communism’s global appeal,” making it incapable of meeting the widespread yearning for a better and more open life.
China has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interests and playing classical balance-of-power geopolitics.
But, in order to displace the US and assume the mantle of leadership in Asia, China must do more than pursue its own interests or contain potential rivals.
Most fundamentally, what does China represent in terms of values and ideas?
In the absence of an answer to that question, China’s overly assertive policies have proven a diplomatic boon for the US in strengthening and expanding American security arrangements in Asia.
South Korea has tightened its military alliance with the US, Japan has backed away from a move to get the US to move its Marine airbase out of Okinawa, and India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, among others, have drawn closer to the US.
In terms of power-projection force capabilities or the range of military bases and security allies in Asia, no power or combination of powers is likely to match the US in the next quarter-century.
But, while America’s continued central role in Asia is safe, the long-term viability of its security arrangements boils down to the credibility of its security assurances to allies and partners.
America’s readiness to stand by them when the game gets rough will determine the strength and size of its security-alliance system in Asia in the years ahead.
The third and fourth scenarios can unfold even if the US remains the principal security anchor for Asia.
A number of Asian countries have already started building mutually beneficial security cooperation on a bilateral basis, thereby laying the groundwork for a potential web of interlocking strategic partnerships.
A constellation of Asian states linked by strategic cooperation, in fact, has become critical to help institute power stability in the region.
A New Bargain for UN Reform
The United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions.
No sooner was the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has erupted. The United States is pressing for administrative reforms and threatening to cut off funding if the reforms are not forthcoming.
The Secretary General has submitted a reasonable reform plan, but a majority of UN member states, acting together as the so-called G-77, are balking, because they regard it as another step in reducing the authority of the General Assembly relative to the Security Council.
In particular, they object to the plan’s proposal to give increased powers and responsibilities to the Secretary General, whose selection is effectively in the hands of the Security Council’s five permanent members, which wield veto power.
Many UN members, believing that power within the UN has been shifting from the General Assembly, resist giving up what they regard as its last vestige: control over the budget through the work of the Assembly’s Fifth Committee.
In practice, the Fifth Committee has exercised the kind of micro-management over personnel and expenditure that ought to be exercised by the Secretary General if the UN is to operate effectively and to have a staff which is up to the challenges facing the organization.
This is the basis of America’s insistence on administrative reforms.
There is an urgent need to find a way out of this impasse.
Failure of the current proposal would mean an effective end to all efforts to reform the UN, with disastrous consequences for people across the world who depend on the aid provided by the UN Development Program, the security provided by the UN’s numerous peacekeeping operations, or the myriad other services rendered by UN agencies.
For example, failure of management reform would fuel demands by the US Congress to withhold America’s contributions to the UN budget – a policy that would greatly undermine America’s own interests, such as the planned expansion of the mission to stop genocide in Darfur.
The path to a satisfactory resolution is clear: give the General Assembly a greater role in the selection of the Secretary General so that members would be delegating powers to an authority of their own choosing.
This solution would not only permit the much-needed administrative reforms to be implemented; it would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that is in great need of improvement.
After all, the UN Charter provides that “the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.” The original concept was that the two bodies would reach a consensus on a candidate.
In practice, however, the five permanent members now agree on a candidate, and their decision is rubber-stamped first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
Real discussions about a new Secretary General are currently being conducted in secrecy among the permanent five, adding to the frustration of other UN members, including large powers that have been seeking without success to enlarge the Security Council.
To achieve the reforms of the budget process that it wants, the US will need to lead the way in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the process.
This might be done in several ways.
The Security Council might agree to recommend several candidates from which the General Assembly would select one.
Alternatively, the General Assembly might propose several candidates to the Security Council, from which the Council would choose one to refer back to the Assembly for approval.
Either way, the selection process would benefit from greater transparency.
For example, the General Assembly should hold public hearings in which candidates are interviewed, thereby greatly enhancing the stature of the candidate who is eventually selected.
Such proposals, if accepted, would help resolve the current dispute to everyone’s satisfaction.
Indeed, they could make the UN stronger than it has ever been.
A New Chance for Darfur
NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY – As the crisis in Sudan’s Darfur region worsens and negotiaitions to end it drag on, an international consensus is emerging around a “muscular” policy based on public denunciation, severe economic sanctions, and, increasingly, threats of military force.
But none of these steps, taken alone or together, can bring about the ends that their often well-intentioned advocates seek.
On the contrary, they risk reproducing the havoc that such measures have unleashed in Iraq and elsewhere in recent years.
In the United States, cautionary voices have been notably absent even among staunchly liberal newspapers like The New York Times .
Foreign policy advisers to the Democratic Party and neo-conservatives alike have called for “action” against Sudan – demands that have been echoed by an international group of intellectuals and celebrities ranging from Umberto Eco, Jürgen Habermas, and Harold Pinter to Bob Geldof, George Clooney, Mia Farrow, Matt Damon, Mick Jagger, and J.K. Rowling.
Meanwhile, French troops, with the support of other European Union members – notably Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Poland, Romania, and Sweden – are now deployed for putatively humanitarian reasons in the Central African Republic and Chad, where they have already clashed with Sudanese government forces.
The International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch, and many other organizations support this deployment, while Save Darfur, despite describing itself as a non-political “alliance of more than 180 faith-based, advocacy, and humanitarian organizations,” has, in fact, been pivotal in setting the policy agenda.
This agenda’s interventionism is incremental: tougher economic sanctions, demands that China exercise its influence, creation of a “no-fly zone,” and military force against the Sudanese army.
The assumption is that only real pressure will finally force Sudan’s government to embrace the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force, negotiate with the West, disband the feared Janjaweed militia, allow refugees from the country’s brutal civil war to return to their villages, and make peace with Southern rebels.
But realizing these aims requires cooperation from the government in Khartoum, whereas each of the proposed measures would only heighten tensions or prove useless.
Existing Western sanctions, for example, have merely driven the Sudanese regime into the arms of China, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
Indeed, investment in Sudan has actually grown $2.8 billion over the last year.
Efforts to “pressure” the Chinese appear similarly futile.
Darfur is hardly a high priority for China, which accounts for 20% of African trade, and buys 60% of Sudan’s oil.
Growing talk – both in Europe and America – about boycotting the Olympics (or the opening ceremony) has proven utterly ineffective in influencing China’s behavior in Tibet.
Would the threat of a boycott really prove more successful vis-à-vis Darfur?
Likewise, even proponents of a no-fly zone are doubtful about its potential efficacy.
After all, Sudan is the size of Western Europe, and Darfur is the size of France, with 158 refugee camps.
Strategic constraints would almost certainly overwhelm enforcement.
Finally, there is the “military option,” which would merely justify fears in Sudan of Western “imperialism.”
Worse, given the splintering of rebel forces in the South, where an estimated 80 tribes and clans control their own militias, a military response could generate a power vacuum in Sudan and destabilize the nine countries – many of them fragile or failed states – on its borders.
Western analysts and activists should have learned by now that and military threats produce only resistance, and that genuine diplomacy involves using carrots as well as sticks.
Yet the emerging policy consensus contains no positive incentives to resolve the Darfur crisis.
Nor is it clear whether its aim is to pressure Sudan into changing its policy or to bring about wholesale regime change.
I have been to Sudan twice, and, as part of a delegation organized by Conscience International, I also visited the refugee camps in Nyala and El Fasher in Darfur.
I have met with dozens of Sudanese politicians and diplomats, and I know that the regime in Khartoum is authoritarian, self-interested, and ruthless.
But it is not monolithic.
Factions within the regime might prove supportive of new policies aimed at tempering the climate of violence in Sudan, decreasing its trade dependency on China, improving conditions for refugees, and lowering international tensions.
Such policies might include:
Normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for removing obstacles to the deployment of UN-AU forces in Darfur. Replacing sanctions on Sudan with new investment opportunities and gradually forgiving its foreign debt in exchange for achievement of benchmarks tied to repatriating refugees, rebuilding villages, and demobilizing the Janjaweed ; Calling on not only the government, but also the rebel forces, over which the West has some influence, to bargain in good faith; Engaging China’s desire for international prestige by encouraging it to assume a public role in designing and overseeing repatriation, demobilization, and vocational programs; Offering aid to the Sudanese in rebuilding the tribal reconciliation councils that were destroyed during the civil war; Reintegrating Sudan into the international community through academic exchanges, conferences, political visits, and the like; Strengthening the AU, which Western analysts have consistently underestimated with almost indescribable arrogance, in order to foster African solutions to African problems. The emerging policy consensus toward Sudan is predicated on an approach that has already undermined respect for Western values throughout the non-Western world.
Its interventionist measures won’t work. They are unrealistic and, ultimately, counterproductive.
There is no time to lose in trying something new.
A New Dawn for Chinese Journalism?
A remarkable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists.
Earlier this year, the government suspended publication of the newspaperBing Dian Weekly, provoking unprecedented open protest, which received extensive media coverage worldwide.
Even more surprisingly, the government, under the pressure of public opinion, has allowedBing Dianto resume publication.
The editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief were sacked, but the open questioning of the legitimacy of the government’s authority to regulate journalism is bound to have a profound impact.
Foreign observers are prone to associate theBing Dianincident with other recent crackdowns on China’s mass media, and to conclude that Chinese journalism freedom is hopeless under the present autocratic regulation.
Undeniably, there has been no significant change in the government’s system of journalism’s regulation since China adopted its “open door” policy almost 30 years ago.
On the contrary, it has become more rigorous and covert.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });But I still have faith that subtle changes are occurring.
A prerequisite of effective control of the media is that the controlled accept the controller’s ideology.
After 1949, the Communist Party cultivated a stable of “theoretical experts” and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating “Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.”
But nowadays, such writers are hard to find, and their work is received by readers with mockery and sarcasm.
In fact, the Central Propaganda Department’s ideological control can be maintained only through internal notices and telephone calls, which are widely scorned.
More importantly, even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines.
I recently met an official working for a provincial Department of Propaganda and was impressed by his bold and straightforward comments on current affairs.
In private conversation, one might even take him for a liberal – one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity.
For their part, producers of news have long since ceased to believe that news is propaganda.
I started my career with China Youth Dailyin 1979 and have experienced the whole process of China’s opening up and reformation.
Our generation of Chinese journalists broke from traditional Communist ideas about journalism by the mid-1980’s through extensive reading of Western journalism.
Younger journalists have thus been exposed to Western journalistic ideas from the very beginning.
Indeed, Western works are taught as “models for writing” to journalism students in China’s universities.
This is a crucial change, and it is the fundamental reason for an increasing number of genuine news items and commentaries in China’s media today.
Market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change.
Contrary to foreign perceptions, only a handful of Chinese media – for example,People’s Daily, Guang Ming Daily, and theEconomic Daily – still live on government funds.China Central Television relies mainly on its advertising income, with only a symbolic fraction of its massive budget covered by the government.
Whether most media outlet can survive is thus solely dependent on their market success.
To be sure, political information remains rigorously controlled, which puts a premium on “harmless” recreational, entertainment, and sports information – the reporting of which is basically free.
This has resulted, in the short run, in an embrace of low journalistic standards.
But many metropolitan newspapers that once thrived on infotainment have seen their circulation fall in recent years.
Sooner or later, readers will start to buy newspapers that can truly inform them and give voice to their opinions.
In fact, it is these tabloids, responding to market pressure, that have started to take on responsibility as public watchdogs.
On many occasions in recent years, they have been the first to break sensitive news.
As a result, mainstream media are being marginalized, and the previously marginalized media are becoming mainstream.
Thus, even without any change in the current system of regulation, extensive coverage of disasters, judicial abuses, and citizens’ pursuit of their statutory rights, along with the questioning of policies from public perspectives, is now common.
For example, reporting by theSouth Metropolitan Daily led to the abolition of an outdated housing ordinance issued by the State Council.Cai Jing magazine’s continuous reporting on SARS enabled the Chinese public to learn the truth about this epidemic.
TheBing DianWeekly ofChina Youth Dailypublished an article by Taiwanese writer Long Yingtai on Taiwan’s democratic development.
Such progress is slow and full of frustrations, for it reflects the incremental evolution of the system.
But it is nonetheless real progress, indicating the growing influence of the Chinese media and pointing to China’s becoming a country of “free expression”.
According to an old Chinese saying, “a just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds scant support.”
A “just cause” resides in people’s hearts.
Without the hearts of news producers – or, increasingly, of censors – the seemingly formidable edifice of journalistic regulation will, sooner or later, collapse like the Berlin Wall.
A New Deal for Poor Farmers
NEW YORK – Many poor, food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months, as global prices of rice, wheat, and maize have doubled.
Hundreds of millions of poor people, who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food, are being pushed to the edge.
Food riots are mounting. 
But many poor countries can grow more food themselves, because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible.
In some cases, with appropriate government action, they could double or even triple food production in just a few years. 
The idea is basic and well known.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
Poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season, lack fertilizer, depend on rain rather than irrigation, and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe.
Their farms are small, perhaps one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
Under traditional agricultural conditions, the yields of grain – rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet – are usually around one ton per hectare, for one planting season per year.
For a farm family of five or six living on one hectare, this means extreme poverty, and for their country, it means reliance on expensive food imports, including food aid. 
The solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons – and in some places to three or more tons – per hectare.
If water can be managed through irrigation, this could be combined with multi-cropping (multiple harvests per year) to produce a crop during the dry season.
Higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families, and lower food prices for cities.
The key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties (usually “hybrid” seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties), chemical fertilizers, organic matter to replenish soil nutrients, and, where possible, small-scale irrigation methods, such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well.
There is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960’s.
The problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries.
When peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral, they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation.
As a result, they grow food the traditional way, often earning little or nothing from their harvest, because it’s not even enough to keep their families alive.
History has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap.
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies, income can rise, and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral.
With a bit of temporary help, perhaps lasting around five years, farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis, either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans.
Around the world, government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs, but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies.
Of course, there were abuses, such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones, or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy.
And in many cases, government agricultural banks went bankrupt.
Still, the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid.
During the debt crisis of the 1980’s and 1990’s, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems.
Poor farmers were told to fend for themselves, to let “market forces” provide for inputs.
This was a profound mistake: there were no such market forces. 
Poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties.
They could not obtain bank financing.
To its credit, the World Bank recognized this mistake in a scathing internal evaluation of its long-standing agricultural policies last year.
The time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries, notably those farming on two hectares or less, to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons, and has doubled its food production as a result.
Other low-income countries should follow suit.
Importantly, the World Bank, under its new president, Robert Zoellick, has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach.
If the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs, then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time.
Donor governments, including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, should help finance the World Bank’s new efforts.
The world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions (such as Haiti) during the next five years.
That’s achievable if the World Bank, donor governments, and poor countries direct their attention to the urgent needs of the world’s poorest farmers.
A New Deal for the Lisbon Strategy
Whatever happened to the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy?
Not only is the public almost entirely ignorant of the EU’s policy agenda for boosting competitiveness, economic growth, and employment, but this ignorance extends to many intellectuals, academics, CEO’s, and even some MP’s.
For example, in all of the debates on the EU’s constitutional treaty, neither its supporters nor its opponents have so much as mentioned the Lisbon Strategy.
It is little wonder, then, that Euroskepticism – in France, the Netherlands, and elsewhere – is on the rise.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Despite the success and popularity of programs like ERASMUS, citizens don’t perceive the EU’s contribution to superior education or training.
Indeed, the last Eurobarometer survey on the Lisbon Strategy found that the European public sees little relation between EU policies and economic competitiveness.
Of course, some laboratories receive EU grants, but without recognizing a specific European mission in research policies.
Europe is generally considered more a constraint than as a plan, more as an instrument than a vision nourished by a clear and credible idea.
The essential responsibility for this state of affairs lies with Europe’s ruling class and policymakers.
As a recent assessment by former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok pointed out, the EU’s member states generally have not made the Lisbon Strategy a high priority, and they balk at giving the EU the means to pursue more ambitious policies to offset this neglect.
It is difficult to ask citizens to be enthusiastic about aims that their leaders ignore.
At bottom, the problem is one of legitimacy.
The main targets – jobs, growth, and research – are considered legitimate from the standpoint of fairness when described in general terms.
But the concrete policies needed to realize this aim are not, since reforming the welfare state and labor markets means more competition, which scares many citizens.
Legitimacy is even more problematic regarding recognition, which implies a feeling of community and attachment.
When we are faced with conflicting choices – burden-sharing through taxation, the organization of the public sector, the status of public employees, etc. – the member states are considered to be the only bodies entitled to decide.
In short, when the EU brings subsidies, it receives congratulations; but when it pushes for unpopular reforms, it becomes the scapegoat for political, social, and economic failures.
From an economic point of view, the Lisbon Strategy’s aim is to transform Europe into a power able to compete on equal terms with the US today and the great Asian countries.
But this aim does not appear to be creating a European identity, as the euro has.
Within many states, “power” isn’t politically correct.
Above all, there is no linkage between national power and European power.
If we want Europe to be more legitimate, we must explain how to tie these two dimensions of power.
Aside from ignorance of the Lisbon Strategy among the public and inaction on long-term reforms among the member states, a second problem concerns the lack of acceptance of the virtues of competition – the most effective way to ensure quality, innovation, and low prices for consumers.
Competition also puts an end to rent seeking and protection of traditional corporate advantages.
Of course, we must limit the scope of competition: there is no reason, for example, to extend it to taxation.
Similarly, while competition will improve the quality of research and education, this does not imply reduced public funding, a lower priority for basic research, or the elimination of scholarships.
Perhaps most importantly, competition is a powerful means to restore democracy and modernize political institutions by compelling policymakers to ensure transparency and accountability.
Elites must give up their privileges, and regulations on corporate governance must limit collusion between managers and civil servants or politicians.
We must explain to citizens Europe’s contribution to public ethics, and the democratic virtues of fair competition in economic, political, and social life.
Consider one of the main purposes of the Lisbon Strategy: the organization of research and higher education.
It is impossible to change radically the way scholars and research workers are appointed in most member states, and to revise completely the criteria for funding of faculties and laboratories.
But the EU can overcome national impediments by developing exemplary universities and research centers that would be properly European, serving as an incentive to quality and reform at the national level.
Emulation through excellence is the motor of competitiveness.
A good place to start is an idea supported by French Socialist leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has proposed that 0.25% of Europe’s GDP be dedicated to research and used to create a European Agency for Research.
Moreover, Europe must build up tools for strategic analysis, assessment, and forecasting to provoke and nourish public debate.
Such think tanks at the European level must remain free and independent, but leaders must learn to pay attention to and integrate their recommendations into the policy-making process.
In many matters pertaining to the Lisbon Strategy, the EU cannot avoid member states’ concerns.
But as the states won’t be able to do everything alone and won’t renounce maintaining political control, we must be able to link the Union’s policies and those of specific states.
Otherwise, the Lisbon Strategy could merely empower an inefficient bureaucracy, rather than boosting the EU’s democratic legitimacy.
In short, the Lisbon Strategy could lead Europe to become a real power in the coming decades, or it could fuel further growth of Euroskepticism.
A New Deal for the New World
As former members of our countries' congresses we believe that it is time to create a North American Parliamentary Union (NAPU) to address the growing number of big issues that North America's national governments have pushed to the sidelines.
Both past and present have been burdened by thead hoc nature of relations among the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
A fairer, more prosperous future for all three countries demands that we take a bold step forward.
Despite US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's snide reference to ``Old Europe,'' North Americans can learn much from the European Union and European Parliament.
In the 1950's, most of Europe considered the idea of a Union with a single Parliament a pipe dream.
Today the EU elects its Parliament, shares a single currency, and controls a budget that emphasizes raising living standards within the less developed member countries.
Within the near future, the EU is likely to be 450 million people strong.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The combined population of the US, Mexico, and Canada is about 410 million people.
Yet North America has failed to match Europe in building the political structures necessary to focus the hemisphere on the problems of immigration, cross border security, labor rights, and environmental degradation; or in facilitating a more united approach to strong economic competition from Europe and Asia.
On the contrary, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, relations between the US and its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are at their lowest level in years.
Clearly, efforts to deepen North American political and economic integration will be an uphill battle.
In the near future, the US government will be focused on homeland security, Iraq, the slumping domestic economy, and the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.
Canada's government has been more willing to approach North American issues on a bilateral basis than in a tri-national context; furthermore, Canadians are preoccupied with the consequences and aftermath of SARS and mad cow disease, as well as anticipating a new government next year.
Mexico's President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006.
But his vision of a North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) encompassing elements of social and political fusion with his North American counterparts was sidetracked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and by his political rivals' recent successes at the polls.
Notwithstanding this, most Canadians and Mexicans believe that cooperation in North America will proceed regardless of who is in office in Ottawa, Washington, or Mexico City.
Not only are Canada and Mexico the US's first and second largest trading partners, but the three countries maintain a myriad of relationships--in business, tourism, and culture--that do not pass through their embassies or governments.
Good feelings abound.
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico: 90% and 70%, respectively.
In proposing the creation of NAPU, we envision a specific plan to create a larger market by fostering an alliance between the three economies.
In just a single decade, the EU managed to bring poorer, peripheral member states--Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland--from 50% to 90% of the EU average in per capita income, creating a bigger market for companies from wealthier northern countries, and stemming migration from poorer southern economies.
The EU invested upwards of $35 billion a year to assure the success of their Common Market integration.
North America has largely ignored the significance of ``common,'' preferring to focus on ``market.''
This blinded all three countries to the centrality of community.
We have failed to understand that a North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) that achieves its full potential cannot be accomplished on the cheap.
A regional political structure will maintain the focus on vital but difficult issues such as immigration.
NAFTA was conceived under the assumption that expanded trade would trickle down benefits to all in the three countries.
Regretfully, this corporate-driven NAFTA exacerbated the disparities and asymmetries between Mexico and its two richer northern neighbors.
Moreover, throughout NAFTA's lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society.
Immigration illustrates the cost of integration without convergence.
Demand for low-cost Mexican labor by US employers and the 10-1 wage gap between the two countries pushes 350,000 Mexicans to risk their lives every year for better paid jobs north of the border.
Without Mexican manpower, much of the work in the US simply would not get done.
The issue must be addressed, not ignored and criminalized.
NAPU would be the ideal forum in which to address this concern.
Everywhere nowadays, key decisions are made by a self-selected group of elites, often in non-transparent circumstances.
NAPU would allow for wider, more consistent participation in the consideration of issues now ignored in all three countries.
Inter-American issues can no longer be left subject to the whims and convenience of individual leaders.
The people of the US, Canada, and Mexico deserve better.
A New Democratic Agenda for Russia
MOSCOW – When Russian President Dmitri Medvedev delivered his annual address to the Federal Assembly I was struck by the fact that his speech seemed to be meant for an advanced, prosperous country, not the real Russia of today.
Russia will hold a presidential election in 2012.
What happens in 2011 will, in my opinion, be even more important than the election itself.
Indeed, the evolution of Russian society could transform Russian politics, despite those domestic opponents who deny change or those who unqualifiedly classify Russia as “incorrigibly authoritarian.”
But, in order for that to happen, a new agenda for Russia must be developed this year.
A decade ago, defense of Russia’s territorial integrity and restoration of governability topped the list of priorities.
People supported a president, Vladimir Putin, who was devoted to this “stabilization” agenda.
We may debate the means by which it was pursued, and how successfully, but Russia’s “existential” challenges were largely overcome.
But progress on stabilization only highlighted Russia’s unresolved problems, which the global financial crisis exacerbated, but did not cause.
After all, Russia’s resource-based, de-industrializing, expenditure-driven economy is the result of purely domestic choices.
Nor was it the crisis that gave rise to corruption, which affects officialdom at all levels, or that caused Russia to lose its democratic dynamic.
We Russians rode along on oil and gas, forgetting that these resources will not last forever.
But, even with favorable world market conditions, we did not manage to solve the problem of poverty, in which millions of Russians still live.
I am convinced that Russia’s troubles all come down to politics.
We need a democratic, competitive environment, initiative at all levels, an active civil society, and real public control.
Only under such conditions will difficult problems lend themselves to solution.
But, starting in 2005-2006, the authorities implemented measures that made responsiveness to acute problems practically impossible.
The decisions to appoint, rather than elect, regional governors, to introduce party-list voting, to raise the electoral threshold for parties to enter the Duma, and to repeal the minimum-turnout requirement – all accompanied by rampant manipulation of elections and the mass media – created a political system closed to feedback from society.
Not surprisingly, the political elite became self-absorbed and served only its own narrow interests.
This summer, with wildfires raging outside Moscow, the elite’s isolation took on a menacing nature.
But something else happened: society became more demanding, recognizing its own interests and knowing how to express them.
Although the traditions of self-organization in Russian society are neither deep nor strong, real movement in this direction became visible for all to see.
Activists from public movements, journalists, ecologists, businessmen, and ordinary people who had suffered the tyranny and corruption of public officials began to join in.
The authorities have recognized this, at least to some degree.
Medvedev's decision to suspend construction of a highway through the Khimki forest near Moscow in the face of widespread civic protest was important.
For many months, Moscow and federal authorities ignored the highway’s opponents, so Medvedev’s decision was a signal: contempt for the people is inadmissible.
Yet right after that, the bureaucracy tried to turn the public hearings – called to give people and civil institutions a voice in solving such problems – into an empty formality.
So the struggle between democratic and anti-democratic tendencies is becoming acute.
If the anti-democratic tendencies win out, all that we have accomplished in previous years will be jeopardized – including stability itself.
This threat evidently motivated Medvedev to speak out in November: “It is no secret,” Medvedev wrote in his blog, “that, as of a certain period, symptoms of stagnation have begun to appear in our political life, and the threat of turning stability into a factor of stagnation has appeared.”
The president’s statement was unexpected.
Medvedev’s assessment attested to his understanding that Russia’s problems are rooted in its politics – in the degradation of the ruling party, in the absence of a real opposition, and in the lack of respect for the rights of political minorities.
I welcome Medvedev’s emphasis on social concerns and his anti-bureaucratic rhetoric.
But his statements are only a first step toward formulating a new Russian agenda, the first point of which must be a renewal and acceleration of movement toward real and effective democracy.
It is vital that Russians believe that Medvedev’s words reflect his priorities, and that he is prepared to fight for them.
Among these priorities, one of the most important is education.
We have approached the point when the constitutional requirement of universal, free education may become a fiction.
People are asking: How is it that, after World War II, the state had enough money to provide free education, whereas today’s Russian state does not?
Society also demands effective mechanisms for combating corruption, which is turning into a serious political problem, precisely because it has widened the gap between the people and the authorities.
Indeed, today’s elite cannot or will not solve the problem.
Only a serious presidential initiative, supported by civil society and brave new political forces, can do the job.
The new agenda must also include a strong economic component.
Patching up holes in the budget and individual initiatives are not enough to ensure economic renewal.
Russia needs a breakthrough toward an up-to-date, knowledge-based, and ecologically sustainable economy.
Here, I see a direct connection with the problem of education.
I am convinced that Medvedev must become the leader in the process of formulating the new Russian agenda, and he must act in the coming year.
Society will support him.
A New Era for Islamic Science?
For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out.
Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked.
Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion.
The standard of living was low.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.
Since World War II, the United States has been the world’s undisputed leader in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born.
Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this.
Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed.
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.
Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.
Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
This is one unclaimed opportunity.
But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.
The US has made profound missteps recently.
“Matters of faith” have been substituted for science across government, from the president down.
Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief.
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to “values.”
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980’s.
Japan’s chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book calledTheJapan that Can Say No.
They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership.
The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the “food chain” of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
The book’s title refers to Japan’s plan to “say no” to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.
Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible.
For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.
Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.
The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.
Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.
A New Holy Alliance?
LONDON &#45;&#45; The recent meeting in the Vatican of the “Custodian of The Holy Places,” King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and Pope Benedict XVI was a seminal event, particularly as it comes at a time when radical Muslims are decrying the role of “crusaders” in Middle East politics.
It was also the clearest sign yet of a rising “Holy Alliance” among the world’s conservative leaders.
For the key audience for this meeting of Muslim king and Roman Catholic Pontiff was not their followers, but another conservative leader, President George W. Bush.
The first “Holy Alliance” was a creation of Austria’s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars.
It was an attempt to preserve the peace (and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Metternich’s “Holy Alliance” was the one original political idea to emerge from Napoleon’s defeat.
Behind its exalted name lay an innovation of great diplomatic significance: the introduction of an element of calculated moral restraint into international relations.
The vested interests that the Alliance members – Austria, Prussia, and Russia – had in the survival of their domestic institutions led each to seek to avoid conflicts that, in the past, they would have pursued as a matter of course.
Metternich’s system worked through much of the nineteenth century, because it protected a genuine balance of power between countries that shared common values.
But what “common values” do King, Pope, and American President share?
That such a meeting took place is a sign that both Pope and King believed that there was something to achieve.
Indeed, Abdullah, who believes himself to be the paramount leader of the Muslim world, is the first Saudi king to initiate a meeting with a leader of the Christian faith.
The two men met, seemingly as equals, not to express the common values of conservatism, but to confirm and promote their authority to uphold traditional values.
Both agreed that reform must be slow, cautious and that it must never undermine established institutions, especially religion and the patriarchal family.
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives.
Until then, he and Bush shared a common worldview, emphasizing the importance of religion, the traditional family (as both countries understood it), social discipline, and the state’s role in supporting these institutions.
But Bush, following the terrorist attacks of 2001, turned his back on conservatism.  He sought to radically reinvent the Middle East, not only by overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, but also through his strident calls for democratization.
American radicalism, however, resulted in increasing tensions between religious communities in the Middle East, and the rise of radical Iran with its bid for regional hegemony.
Since 2001, Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region, including even Lebanon’s Maronite Christian community.
And in Iraq, Sunni Muslims feel under siege from the country’s majority and now ruling Shia.
Here is where the Holy Alliance concept of moral restraint comes in.
Abdullah, perhaps earlier than most others, understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all.
Moreover, Abdullah understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability-seeking alliance that Metternich built.
The King, like Metternich and the Austrian Kaisers, understands de Tocqueville’s dictum that the most dangerous moment for a regime is when it starts to reform.
Having begun, ever so carefully, to politically open his country, the King knows that he needs regional peace and a lowering of Islamic holy rage.
The problem is that Abdullah cannot rely on his domestic conservative allies to give him the time that the Kingdom needs.
The Wahhabi religious establishment, the Saudi state’s hidden co-rulers, could very well obstruct Abdullah’s attempts at regional religious reconciliation.
Members of the religious police remain adamant that the country’s Christian guests must continue to live according to strict Wahhabi rules of behavior.
While the Wahhabis could yet be bribed again with oil money, the sect’s power-hungry judges eagerly await the next beheading, stoning, or lashing in Riyadh’s public square.
Thus, uniting the forces of status quo conservatism, even if some of those conservatives are Christian, is the only viable diplomatic strategy open to Saudi Arabia.
For conservative rulers usually fall when they fail to grasp their own vulnerability, especially when the revolutionary challenge is cloaked in conservative garb.
After all, few political systems can defend against those, like Saudi Arabia’s Islamic radicals, who claim that they can preserve the system and its religious values more effectively than the current rulers. 
Only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers (including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism), Abdullah believes, can restore some stability to the Middle East.
A Glimmer of Hope in Iran
BERLIN – No one could have reckoned with Hassan Rowhani’s victory in Iran’s presidential election.
Even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was probably more than a little surprised by Rowhani’s first-round victory, following a campaign that began with eight candidates.
As a result, the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, as well as the civil war in Syria, may well take on a new dynamic.
But that is how it is in the Middle East: you never know what lies around the corner.
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the launch, at the foreign-minister level, of negotiations between Iran and the European triumvirate of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom on Iran’s nuclear program.
I was there, representing Germany; so was Rowhani, who led the Iranian delegation.
The talks have continued until today – in an expanded format that includes Germany and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the P5+1) – without any tangible results.
Now Rowhani returns to the risky business of Iran’s nuclear program, though this time as President.
What can we – and he – expect?
Based on my personal experience, Rowhani is a polite and open character.
Unlike outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he surrounds himself with very skillful and experienced diplomats.
But there should be no doubt that he is a man of the regime – a realist and moderate member of the Islamic Republic’s political elite – not a representative of the opposition.
And, of course, he backs Iran’s nuclear program.
If Rowhani wants to succeed in office, he will have to keep his promise to improve Iranians’ living conditions without endangering the Islamic Republic in the process.
That will not be easy; in fact, it could amount to trying to square a circle.
The economic improvement that voters demanded in electing Rowhani can almost certainly be achieved only if Western and international sanctions are lifted.
But an end to international sanctions presupposes a breakthrough in the nuclear negotiations.
It may also presuppose at least a temporary settlement of the main regional conflicts.
The Middle East has changed dramatically in the last ten years.
America has reduced its involvement, having withdrawn its troops from Iraq and winding down its engagement in Afghanistan by next year.
At the same time, we are witnessing the dissolution of the old Middle East created by France and Britain after World War I, when Europe’s two great colonial powers created territorial mandates in Palestine, Syria (including present-day Lebanon), Transjordan, and Iraq.
A new regional order is not yet discernible, which points to a future fraught with risk and possible chaos.
As Iran seeks to assert its influence and interests, as well as those of its Shia allies, its dispute with the Security Council over its nuclear program has become closely tied to its regional ambitions.
After all, the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran would most likely exacerbate violent conflict and a nuclear arms race in the region.
As a result, both issues may well have to be addressed successfully prior to any move to lift the sanctions.
Iran and its international interlocutors should learn from the past and manage expectations accordingly. There will not be any quick solutions (if, indeed, there are any solutions at all), given the parties’ diametrically opposed interests, their respective domestic and alliance-related obstacles, and a profound lack of trust on all sides.
Moreover, aside from negotiating with the P5+1, Iran would be well advised to launch direct negotiations with the United States.
It will also most likely have to improve its relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, and change its behavior toward Israel, if a positive result is to be achieved.
Similarly, the West will have to understand that the Islamic Republic is not a monolithic dictatorship.
The regime has multiple coexisting power centers, which influence and limit each other’s decisions.
The office of the president is just one power center.
The same applies to the Supreme Leader, who, despite his title, is not an absolute ruler.
Iran has tried two political approaches in the last ten years: a reformist model, under President Mohamed Khatami, and hardline radicalism, under Ahmadinejad.
Both approaches failed.
The reformers could not overcome conservative opposition, while the radicals could not defeat the domestic economic realities wrought by their foreign and nuclear policies.
Rowhani must seek a path that does not cost him the support of the majority of the regime’s power centers, yet that also allows him to fulfill the mandate he received from voters.
At home, too, massive distrust will further complicate an inherently difficult task.
In America and the West, many will probably regard Rowhani as the friendly face of the Islamic Republic, whereas Ahmadinejad was its true – because more radical – embodiment.
Many Iranians, in turn, regard Obama as the friendly face of a US that still seeks regime change in their country, whereas his predecessor, George W. Bush, was America’s more honest – because more radical – representative.
Both perceptions distort reality, though both contain a kernel of truth.
Despite these perceptions – or perhaps precisely because of them – Rowhani’s presidency offers an unexpected opportunity for both the nuclear negotiations and a political solution in Syria.
Iran’s participation in an international peace conference is an absolute necessity, if only to test Rowhani’s seriousness.
During the Afghanistan conference in Bonn in 2001, Iran behaved in a pragmatic, results-oriented way – an approach that went completely unrewarded by the US.
As for the nuclear negotiations, the P5+1 will focus on objective guarantees that leave Iran no path toward military use of its nuclear capabilities.
For Iran, the focal point of its efforts will be recognition of its right to civilian use of nuclear energy, in keeping with the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its protocols.
Both issues sound simpler than they are: the devil is in the details, and the details leave ample scope for disagreement over the definition, monitoring, and enforcement of terms.
Again, maintaining realistic expectations must be paramount.
A successful outcome in the nuclear negotiations and resolution or even containment of the main regional conflicts will be difficult to achieve.
But it would be the height of irresponsibility not to seize the unexpected opportunity created by Rowhani’s election with all the strength, good faith, and creativity we can muster.
A New Model United Nations
The award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is a cause for true celebration everywhere.
But celebrations should never become an excuse for complacency.
Yes, the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan's leadership.
But the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains, in many parts of the world and for many of the world's most complex problems, more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality.
Some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest.
Beyond states, the world's many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence, but without formal rules to define their role in the international system.
Their real power, despite Secretary General Annan's efforts to create a dialogue with them, stands outside the UN framework.
Indeed, NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });To assist them in their tasks, and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide, the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO's are working so impressively.
Such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN's internal structure.
When the UN was founded in 1945, the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III.
So, at its foundation, only one powerful body was introduced, the Security Council on which the world's great military powers sat.
The agenda of the Security Council was and remains power, and meeting crises, mostly with military means.
Today, however, the real threats to the majority of the world's population stems from dangers almost unknown back then: poverty, hunger, population growth, migration, the environment, and the like. For the UN to meet these challenges, its very structure must change.
Two new councils, each with comparable power to the Security Council, are needed: a Social Council and an Economic Council.
The IMF, World Bank, and WTO should not only report to, but be dependent upon this new UN reformed structure.
Why are these new bodies needed?
The world cannot do without rules; it cannot move forward against our age's most pressing problems without defined legal rules and the institutions that regulate international law.
Because these institutions do not exist, the UN must now invent them.
Of course some rules, such as rules governing the promulgation of trade sanctions, now exist within, say, the WTO.
These rules, however, are but steps in the right direction: steps toward socially and ecologically sustainable free trade and against protectionism, especially that often practiced by rich countries.
Across the board, more global rules are needed so that global efforts to confront poverty, disease, and mass migration can be made consistent, predictable and most of all effective.
We have the Rome Statute of International Criminal Code; we are heading for an innovative guide to best practice on how civil society organizations can best contribute to the work of the UN; and we now have a large coalition, far beyond NATO, combatting terrorism.
I am grateful that one of the reactions to September 11th was, if I am not mistaken, a somewhat changed attitude within the USA vis-à-vis the UN.
But it is of a paramount importance that these kinds of change, namely, to incorporate real power into the structure of the UN, make more progress.
In dangerous times such as these, the world's peoples need to prove their solidarity.
The large coalition now fighting terrorism is one way to demonstrate this.
But solidarity also must be recognized within the real power structures of the UN.
The Secretary General convocation of a ``Dialogue of Civilizations'' is but a start here.
Far more needs to be done.
The institution of Social and Economic Councils at the UN would mark an enormous step in the right direction.
I have tried to present the ideas outlined here not only to the General Assembly but also to the permanent members of the Security Council.
I have also been invited to present them to the US Senate.
So far, none of those discussions have proved to be very fruitful.
But just as the time is coming when the US will to come see the UN as indispensable, the Security Council and its members will come to see the creation of new bodies within the UN not as rivals, but as the only means for the world's people, in solidarity, to confront the myriad social and economic problems that they face.
A Second Chance for European Reform
MUNICH – The European Central Bank has managed to calm the markets with its promise of unlimited purchases of eurozone government bonds, because it effectively assured bondholders that the taxpayers and pensioners of the eurozone’s still-sound economies would, if necessary, shoulder the repayment burden.
Although the ECB left open how this would be carried out, its commitment whetted investors’ appetite, reduced interest-rate spreads in the eurozone, and made it possible to reduce the funding of crisis-stricken economies through the printing press (Target credit).
This respite offers an ideal opportunity to push forward with reforms.
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras must convince his countrymen that he is serious about implementing them.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar deserve more support for their plans.
And one can only hope that Italy’s caretaker prime minister, Mario Monti, contests the next general election.
All of these leaders understand what must be done.
France, by contrast, does not appear to have noticed the writing on the wall.
President François Hollande wants to solve his country’s problems with growth programs.
But when politicians say “growth,” they mean “borrowing.”
That is the last thing that France needs.
France’s debt/GDP ratio is already around 90%; even if its 2013 budget deficit does not exceed 3.5% of GDP, its debt/GDP ratio will have climbed to 93% by the end of the year.
The government’s GDP share, at 56%, is the highest in the eurozone and second highest among all developed countries.
It is not only film actors like Gérard Depardieu who are leaving the country to escape its high taxes; industry is fleeing as well.
France’s once-proud carmakers are fighting for survival.
Indeed, France’s manufacturing industry has shrunk to barely 9% of GDP, less than Britain’s manufacturing share (10%) and less than half of Germany’s (20%).
Its current account is sliding into an ever-deeper deficit hole.
Unemployment is rising to record levels.
France’s basic problem, like that of the countries most affected by the crisis, is that the wave of cheap credit that the euro’s introduction made possible fueled an inflationary bubble that robbed it of its competitiveness.
Goldman Sachs has calculated that France must become 20% cheaper to service its debt on a sustainable basis.
The same is true of Spain, while Italy would have to become 10-15% cheaper and Greece and Portugal would need domestic prices to fall 30% and 35%, respectively.
The OECD purchasing-power statistics paint a similar picture, with Greece needing to depreciate by 39% and Portugal by 32% just to reach the price level prevailing in Turkey.
But, so far, virtually nothing has been done in this respect.
Worse, some of the troubled countries’ inflation rates are still running higher than those of their trading partners.
Eurozone politicians tend to believe that it is possible to regain competitiveness by carrying out reforms, undertaking infrastructure projects, and improving productivity, but without reducing domestic prices.
That is a fallacy, because such steps improve competitiveness only in the same measure as they reduce domestic prices vis-à-vis eurozone competitors.
There is no way around a reduction in relative domestic prices as long as these countries remain in the currency union: either they deflate, or their trading partners inflate faster.
There is no easy or socially comfortable way to accomplish this.
In some cases, such a course can be so perilous that it should not be wished upon any society.
The gap is simply too large between what is needed to restore competitiveness and what citizens can stomach if they remain part of the monetary union.
In order to become cheaper, a country’s inflation rate must stay below that of its competitors, but that can be accomplished only through an economic slump.
The more trade unions defend existing wage structures, and the lower productivity growth is, the longer the slump will be.
Spain and France would need a ten-year slump, with annual inflation 2% lower than that of their competitors, to regain their competitiveness.
For Italy, the path toward competitiveness is shorter, but for Portugal and Greece it is substantially longer – perhaps too long.
Italy, France, and Spain should be able to regain competitiveness in the eurozone within a foreseeable period of time.
After all, Germany cut its prices relative to its eurozone trading partners by 22% from 1995, when the euro was definitively announced, to 2008, when the global financial crisis erupted.
Ten years ago, Germany was like France is today – the sick man of Europe.
It suffered from increasing unemployment and a lack of investment.
Most of its savings were being invested abroad, and its domestic net investment share was among the lowest of all OECD countries.
Under growing pressure to act, Gerhard Schröder’s Social Democratic government decided in 2003 to deprive millions of Germans of their second-tier unemployment insurance, thus paving the way for the creation of a low-wage sector, in turn reducing the rate of inflation.
Unfortunately, thus far, there is no sign that the crisis countries, above all France, are ready to bite the bullet.
The longer they cling to a belief in magic formulas, the longer the euro crisis will be with us.
A New Science
An unusual meeting of scientists took place in Paris this summer, when scientists gathered to brainstorm about the need for a new science, one that could be as revolutionary as Einstein’s insights were a century ago.
Most scientists assume that the basics of science are known.
In terms of big challenges, the conventional wisdom is that few things are left to discover.
The remaining options are said to fall into three groups: “grand scientific quandaries” (such as uniting gravity and electricity into one theory) which require a huge investment and first world infrastructure; “data collection,” which is the field work associated with archeological digs and biological/genetic surveys; and “science-informed problems,” such as combating AIDS or addressing global warming.
Beyond that, many believe the only hard work will be to use existing laws to benefit humankind in new technological ways.
Who can argue?
After all, today’s models work.
But an emerging group of scientists points to phenomena that current theories do not address well.
These problems are exceedingly common and artfully avoided because the science that would account for them just doesn’t exist.
This missing science would describe processes, and how entire systems evolve.
Individual scientific disciplines are understood fairly well.
Physics, at least the physics we encounter as ordinary humans, is well mapped.
Chemistry and biochemistry are similarly solid -- there are some things we don’t understand about the body, but it is believed that the basic machinery of how cells and molecules interact is known.
Slightly apart from these are the new social sciences, which deal with humans and societies.
In each of these areas -- physics, biochemistry and social science -- the theories are mature and largely uncontroversial.
Each discipline has its own language and its own separate machinery.
Rarely is a scientist an expert in more than one area, because the worlds and languages are so different.
This means that we can’t answer complex questions that depend on more than one field.
Consider the brain, for example.
This complex organ is composed of molecules that interact using the principles of physics.
That information moves according to the laws of electricity.
There is also a system of specialized cells, and these interact, exchanging chemicals that also convey information.
The interaction between two brains adds another level: here, information is exchanged by means of languages, signs and ideas.
Information is at work on each level and comfortable theories explain how the separate ones operate.
But information is being exchanged between the levels as well.
There is no science that explains this, even at the most rudimentary level.
To cope with this deficiency, some scientists have tried to reinvent the tools of one level in order to apply them to another.
This leads to such things as a “language” at the level of cells and “energy” behind organized societies.
Sometimes the transplant works well enough, but it does not address the central problem: What is the nature of the information conveyed between each level, and how is it conveyed?
As it happens, nearly every system in the world is composed of such layers.
A similarly embarrassing lack of understanding about how the whole system works exists in every case.
The group of interdisciplinary scientists that met in Paris is loosely affiliated under the banner “Foundations of Information Science.”
They have been working in a distributed collaboration for eight years and come from a range of countries and specialties.
As well as scientists from the relevant disciplines, art theorists, psychiatrists, language experts and philosophers are beginning to participate in the discussion.
Most of the group is banking on the “transplant” strategy, in which the basic science of one layer is placed in another, tweaked and supplemented in order to be functional.
Others think that a whole new approach is required.
They assume that many scientific conventions are accidents of history and new abstractions can be devised.
If the FIS group is lucky, there will also be some radical input from thinkers that do not presently have access to first world infrastructure.
Independent thinking is an underestimated factor.
Nearly all the activities collected under the banner of “science” have developed institutional tendencies that are similar to their economic counterparts.
It is usually assumed that developing economies need to build resources that emulate those in the developed world, but this could actually stifle the most creative thinking.
Many scientific disciples are going through a revolution, and a lot of those ideas -- sometimes revolutionary ideas -- are bubbling up from labs and research centers that are unaffiliated with large institutions.
Twenty years of the most advanced thinking for mathematical algorithms came from a Soviet empire starved of computing power.
The cleverest, most literally earth-shattering notions of physics for two generations came not from the expected powerhouses of the day, but from Budapest.
Iran has a tradition of architectural design that has revealed key insights to cognitive scientists.
Today, some of the most radical new ideas in second generation artificial intelligence (so-called “autonomous agents”) are incubating in Prague.
The most creative breakthroughs became famous events.
When Einstein added new abstractions to the language of physics, the identity of space and time changed.
The FIS meeting in July was the unheralded beginning of an attempt to remodel the universe in such a way.
The group identified the gaps that need explanation.
They will expand their pool of thinkers to include scientists from necessarily innovative regions.
Following this, they will identify which problems might be solved if this new science is developed.
Or if you wish, discovered.
A New Sino-American Relationship?
NEW YORK – The Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the United States and China has now ended with the establishment of a felicitous new atmosphere between the two countries.
But how can this “love-in” be made concrete?
The most logical and potentially fruitful area of collaboration is climate change.
Here, the two US government officials best equipped to lead are Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke.
Chu is a former Berkeley and Stanford professor of physics and head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, while Locke is a former Washington State governor and a long-time supporter of US-China commercial exchanges.
Each packs the kind of soft, utilitarian powers of persuasion that Chinese leaders are most willing to embrace: academic degrees from prestigious universities, advanced scientific and technological knowledge, high office, and a Nobel Prize.
(Chu is one of five ethnic Chinese to have won a Nobel, although no winner has yet come from the PRC, a fact that gnaws at Chinese pride.)
China’s press was abuzz over Chu and Locke, the first ethnic Chinese men to become US Cabinet Secretaries.
Most major Chinese papers ran Chu’s photo on the front page, with Beijing Business Today running a cautionary headline: “Don’t Mistake the Visiting American Ministers as Relatives!”
The paper went on to warn that, “In their own hearts, we are afraid that Chu and Locke put their priorities in exactly the opposite order.”
When Chu gave speeches on energy and climate change at Tsinghua University, China’s most elite institution for science and engineering (where his parents had been students), and then at Tianjin University (where his grandfather was once President), he was received with enormous enthusiasm, overflow crowds, and standing ovations.
So, the Chinese ended up embracing Chu and Locke in contradictory ways: as high-ranking representatives of the US government and as compatriots with whom they share the common bond of Chinese-ness.
Both Chu and Locke are aware that the US and China are now the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and that, if there is any hope of remedying global climate change, the two countries must quickly find a way to collaborate.
Chu emphasized this point in his Tsinghua University speech, calling the global climate situation “very disturbing,” and stressing that we were “all in it together.” “The developed world did make the problem…I admit that,” he acknowledged to his rapt audience.
“But the developing world can make it much worse.”
In announcing a new Sino-US joint research effort, Chu described clean energy as “one of the great opportunities of our time” for Sino-US cooperation, saying that by “working together, we can accomplish more than [by] acting alone.”
Still, one is left wonder if this new collaborative bonhomie and ethnic bonding will prove strong enough to cut through not only the long history of distrustful interactions between the US and China, but also the destabilizing effects of China’s sudden economic rise?
For, although the US has drawn strength from the ideal of a “melting pot” – and President Barack Obama’s cabinet does represent a new high-water mark for diversity – Americans have often shown a xenophobic distrust of immigrants who have drawn too close to power.
Especially in the case of Chinese, fears of divided national loyalties and “fifth columns” have been strong.
One need only recall the recent case of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist who was unjustly accused of spying, to be reminded of how yin and yang are America’s feelings about minority members in sensitive positions.
There is a second obstruction as well: the US Congress refuses to face up realistically to the climate challenge, because China, as a developing country, is not obliged to accept compulsory carbon limits.
Then, because the US refuses to take responsibility for its cumulative and per capita greenhouse-gas emissions – which are, respectively, roughly four and three times greater than China’s – the Chinese leadership refuses to make concessions.
A standoff ensues, which is where we are now.
China recently demanded that the US reduce its emissions by 40% from its 1990 baseline levels and subsidize emission reduction efforts in China and other developing countries to the tune of .05-1% of America’s GDP.
But the recently House-passed Waxman-Markey bill proposes that the US only cut emissions by 3.6% of 1990 baseline levels.
So it is still far from clear what will actually work to bring about an understanding between the US and China that produces real results.
Moreover, with India poking Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the eye over her climate-change entreaties, the world could easily see an even more unified and unyielding bloc emerge among developing countries.
The next moment to watch is Obama’s trip to China in November.
Here, if all the expressions of good feeling cannot be made concrete, an incomparable opportunity to recast Sino-US relations around the issue of climate change will have been lost.
A New Start for Non-Proliferation
VIENNA – US President Barack Obama has injected fresh momentum into efforts – stalled for a decade – to bring about nuclear disarmament.
He has committed himself to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and acknowledges the link between nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states.
Obama has pledged to revitalize the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The non-proliferation regime, of which the NPT is the cornerstone, is in disarray.
The main problems are easily identified.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });First, the five main nuclear-weapon states have not taken seriously their NPT obligation to work for nuclear disarmament.
Instead, they have insisted that nuclear weapons are essential for their security and continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals. This naturally robs them of the moral authority to persuade others not to acquire nuclear weapons, which continue to be perceived as a source of power and influence, and an insurance policy against attack.
Second, as we have seen in the case of North Korea, there is nothing to stop countries that sign the Treaty from simply walking out after declaring that “extraordinary events” have jeopardized their supreme interests.
Third, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is supposed to police the non-proliferation system, is shamefully underfunded.
When it comes to determining whether or not a country is conducting a covert nuclear weapons program, IAEA inspectors often have their hands tied, either because they lack the legal authority to gain access to all the locations they consider necessary, or because the IAEA’s analytical laboratories are outdated, or because the Agency does not have adequate access to satellite imagery.
Fourth, export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan.
Nine countries already have nuclear weapons, and it would be naive to presume that others, particularly in regions of conflict, will not try to get hold of them.
In addition, a number of countries with nuclear energy programs have the capability, if they choose, to manufacture nuclear weapons within a matter of months if their security perceptions change, because they have mastered the critical technology – uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing.
If more countries take this path, it could prove to be the Achilles’ heel of non-proliferation.
Fifth, the international community, spearheaded by the United Nations Security Council, has more often than not been paralyzed in the face of challenges to international security and ineffectual in responding to suspected cases of nuclear proliferation.
These issues will not be resolved overnight. But there is much that can be done relatively quickly.
The United States and Russia have started negotiations on deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals, which together account for 95% of the world’s 27,000 warheads.
Other key steps include bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; negotiating a verifiable treaty to end production of fissile material for use in weapons; radically improving the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials, which is vital to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists; and strengthening the IAEA.
Last month, I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA’s Board of Governors – establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors.
LEU cannot be used to make weapons.
Some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy.
My proposal is to create a physical stockpile of LEU at the disposal of the IAEA as a last-resort reserve for countries with nuclear power programs that face a supply disruption for non-commercial reasons.
This would give countries confidence that they can count on reliable supplies of fuel to run their nuclear power plants, and therefore do not need to develop their own uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capability.
This could help to avoid a repeat of Iran’s experiences after its 1979 revolution, when contracts for fuel and technology for its planned nuclear power program were not honored.
Thirty years later, some of the consequences are still being felt.
The LEU would be available to countries in need on the basis of non-political and non-discriminatory criteria. It would be accessible at market prices to all states in compliance with their nuclear safeguards obligations.
No state would be required to give up the right to develop its own fuel cycle.
The money needed to launch an LEU bank is in place, thanks primarily to a non-governmental organization – the Nuclear Threat Initiative – and initial funding from Warren Buffett. But this can only be a first step.
It should be followed by an agreement that all new enrichment and reprocessing activities will be placed exclusively under multinational control, and that all existing such facilities will be converted from national to multinational control.
This is a bold idea, but bold ideas are needed now more than ever.
The opportunity to put the nuclear fuel cycle under multinational control was missed 60 years ago because of the Cold War.
The spread of nuclear technology and the growing risk of nuclear terrorism make it imperative that we get it right this time.
A New-State Solution for Israel and Palestine
PRINCETON – Imagine a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine in which Palestinians would have the right of return; Israelis could settle wherever they could purchase land in the West Bank; and Jerusalem need not be divided.
This is not a fanciful vision, but a creative and eminently sensible reinvention of twenty-first century statehood.
And US President Barack Obama’s just-completed visit to Israel provides an opportunity to explore genuinely new thinking.
Ever since Bill Clinton nearly succeeded in brokering a comprehensive settlement in 2000, the mantra among supporters of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been that, while a solution exists, Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are willing to reach it do not.
The solution is a version of the deal that Clinton sought: two sovereign states based on the 1967 borders, with negotiated land swaps to reflect existing settlement patterns.
The agreement would include a land corridor connecting Gaza and the West Bank; a divided Jerusalem with guaranteed access for all to religious sites; Palestinians’ renunciation of the right of return; Israel’s willingness to dismantle settlements outside the agreed borders; and recognition of both states across the Middle East.
But suppose that the reason that no Palestinians and Israelis willing to conclude such a deal have emerged is that the solution itself is domestically unsupportable on both sides. Suppose that as long as a version of this deal is the only game in town, the creeping physical expansion of the Israeli state and the demographic expansion of Israeli Arabs will continue to erode its foundation.
For all the dire warnings that the window for a two-state solution is rapidly closing (or has already closed), it is the solution itself that is the problem.
In 2008, a Princeton University graduate student in philosophy named Russell Nieli gave a talk at the Princeton Center for Jewish Life that was so well received that he later expanded it into an article for the US-based magazine Tikkun, founded by Rabbi Michael Lerner.
The article, “Toward a Permanent Palestinian/Israeli Peace – the Case for Two-State Condominialism,” was published with the express aim of stimulating “productive thinking among a younger generation of Jews and Arabs not bound by the restricted vision and failed policies of the past.”
“Two-state condominialism” is as visionary as the name is clunky.
The core idea is that Israelis and Palestinians would be citizens of two separate states and thus would identify with two separate political authorities.
Palestine would be defined as a state of the Palestinian people, and Israel as a Jewish state.
Under “condominialism,” however, both Palestinians and Jews “would be granted the right to settle anywhere within the territory of either of the two states, the two states thus forming a single, binational settlement community.”
Think about that for a minute.
As Nieli describes it, Palestinians “would have the right to settle anywhere within Israel just as Jews would have the right to settle anywhere within the territory of the Palestinian state.
Regardless of which of the two states they lived in, all Palestinians would be citizens of the Palestinian state, all Jews citizens of Israel.”
Each state would have the authority and the obligation to provide for the economic, cultural, religious, and welfare needs of its citizens living in the other state’s territory.
These would be extraterritorial rights and responsibilities, just as the United States, for example, provides for its large numbers of expatriates, such as civilian dependents of US military personnel based abroad.
To make this work, the borders of each state would first have to be defined – presumably on the basis of the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed territorial swaps.
Israeli Arabs would then be required to transfer their citizenship, national identity, and national voting rights – but not their residence – to the new Palestinian state.
They would have a permanent right to live in Israel and would retain the benefits to which they are currently entitled as Israeli citizens, but they would now vote as citizens of Palestine.
All other Palestinians living in Israel would have rights and benefits only under Palestinian law.
Condominialism recognizes the reality of the deep interconnectedness of Israeli settlers in the West Bank with the rest of Israel –&#160;through roads, water supplies, electricity grids, administrative structures, and economic relationships (just as Israeli and Palestinian parts of Jerusalem are interdependent).
Instead of trying to separate and recreate all of these structures and relationships, it makes far more sense to build on them in ways that benefit both states’ peoples and economies.
And, in a world in which many citizens spend an increasing proportion of their time in virtual space, de facto condominialism is already happening.
In the 1950’s, after four decades of war across Europe, the idea of a European Union in which member states’ citizens could live and work freely across national borders while retaining their political allegiance and cultural identity seemed equally far-fetched.
(Indeed, the name of the political process by which the EU was to be constructed, “neo-functionalism,” was every bit as abstract and cumbersome as “two-state condominialism.”)
Yet French and German statesmen summoned the vision and the will to launch a bold experiment, one that has evolved into a single economy of 500 million people.
Why shouldn’t another site of ancient enmities be the source of a new conception of statehood?
Interestingly, many young people in the 1950’s, like my Belgian mother, ardently supported the vision of a new Europe.
Today’s young Israelis and Palestinians pride themselves on their entrepreneurialism, with all the risk and vision that starting something new entails.
Supporting and contributing to an innovative political start-up would be their generation’s defining act.
A New US Agenda for Latin America
MEXICO CITY – For the next American president, fixing the international mess inherited from the Bush administration will be no simple task.
While Latin America will not be a priority for either an Obama or McCain administration, continuing the United States’ neglect of the last seven years is no longer viable.
Two distinct political/diplomatic challenges stand out: Cuba’s imminent transition or succession crisis, and the continuing ascent of the region’s “two lefts,” one represented by Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez and the other by Brazil’s increasingly influential President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The next US administration will only prove successful if it grasps that Latin America is living through a moment that combines the best and worst aspects of its history: the fastest economic growth since the 1970’s, with poverty and inequality diminishing, and more democratic and respectful of human rights than ever before, but becoming more politically polarized.
In Cuba, Fidel Castro’s eventual passing from the scene represents an immense challenge.
The US cannot continue with the failed policies of the past half-century.
Demanding a full-fledged democratic transition as a pre-condition for normalizing US-Cuban relations is both unrealistic and unpalatable to Latin America.
Yet the US cannot set aside the question of democracy and human rights in Cuba while it awaits the departure of Fidel’s brother, Raúl.
Realpolitik and fear of another exodus of Cuban refugees across the Florida Straits may tempt the US to pursue a “Chinese” or “Vietnamese” solution to Cuba: normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for economic reform, while leaving the question of internal political change until later.
But the US should not succumb to this temptation.
The US, Canada, Europe, and Latin America have constructed a regional legal framework, which must not be abandoned, to defend democratic rule and human rights in the hemisphere.
Cuba needs to return to the regional concert of powers, but it must accept this concert’s rules.
Holding free and fair elections may not be the primary issue, but nor are they issues that should be shelved in the interests of stability and expediency.
Elections must instead be part of a comprehensive process of normalization: they should neither be a deal-breaker nor a non-issue.
While the US should lift its trade embargo as soon as Cuba’s transition begins, everything else should be conditional on Cuba initiating a process of resolving all outstanding issues.
But Cuba is just part of what might be called Latin America’s “left” problem.
Indeed, much has been written recently about the ascent of the left in Latin America over the past decade.
In fact, there are two lefts in the region: a modern, democratic, globalized and market-friendly left, found in Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, parts of Central America, and, up to a point, in Peru; and a retrograde, populist, authoritarian, statist, and anti-American left, found in Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, and, to a lesser extent, in Argentina, Colombia, and Paraguay.
Some of these “lefts” are in power; some, as in Mexico in its last, disputed presidential election, barely missed conquering it, but may still do so.
Over the past two years, it has become increasingly evident that the “modern” or “soft” left is, all in all, governing well. The other left has proved to be more extreme and erratic than many anticipated.
The former feels no urge to “export” its “model,” whereas the latter has a strategy and the means to do so.
The retrograde left today can realize Che Guevara’s old dream: not “one, two, many Vietnams,” but “one, two, many Venezuelas,” winning power by the ballot and then conserving and concentrating it through constitutional changes and the creation of armed militias and monolithic parties.
It can finance all of this with the support of Venezuela’s state oil company, implementing social policies that are misguided over the long term but seductive in the short run, especially when carried out by Cuban doctors, teachers, and instructors.
Herein lies a dilemma for the next US president: how to address the clear rift between the two lefts in a way that improves US-Latin American relations, fortifies the modern left, and weakens the retrograde left without resorting to the failed interventionist policies of the past.
The best, strictly Latin America-focused steps, are self-evident, if not easily achievable.
They require strengthening those governments of the modern left, or those of the center or center-right threatened by the old-fashioned left, and simultaneously making it clear to the latter that there is a price to be paid for violating the basic tenets of democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law.
Turning its back in the face of such challenges is no longer a viable American option.
Aside from areas of particular concern (oil, arms, guerrillas, drugs), the US needs Latin America dearly nowadays because resistance to it is springing up everywhere, and with greater virulence than at any time since World War II’s end.
The next US president must reinvigorate a relationship that is ready to be substantially transformed for the first time since Franklin Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy of seven decades ago.
A New World Architecture
NEW YORK – Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization: international capitalism and state capitalism.
The former, represented by the United States, has broken down, and the latter, represented by China, is on the rise.
Following the path of least resistance will lead to the gradual disintegration of the international financial system.
A new multilateral system based on sounder principles must be invented.
While international cooperation on regulatory reform is difficult to achieve on a piecemeal basis, it may be attainable in a grand bargain that rearranges the entire financial order.
A new Bretton Woods conference, like the one that established the post-WWII international financial architecture, is needed to establish new international rules, including treatment of financial institutions that are too big to fail and the role of capital controls.
It would also have to reconstitute the International Monetary Fund to reflect better the prevailing pecking order among states and to revise its methods of operation. 
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In addition, a new Bretton Woods would have to reform the currency system.
The post-war order, which made the US more equal than others, produced dangerous imbalances.
The dollar no longer enjoys the trust and confidence that it once did, yet no other currency can take its place.
The US ought not to shy away from wider use of IMF Special Drawing Rights.
Because SDRs are denominated in several national currencies, no single currency would enjoy an unfair advantage.
The range of currencies included in the SDRs would have to be widened, and some of the newly added currencies, including the renminbi, may not be fully convertible.  This would, however, allow the international community to press China to abandon its exchange-rate peg to the dollar and would be the best way to reduce international imbalances.
And the dollar could still remain the preferred reserve currency, provided it is prudently managed.
One great advantage of SDRs is that they permit the international creation of money, which is particularly useful at times like the present.
The money could be directed to where it is most needed, unlike what is happening currently.
A mechanism that allows rich countries that don’t need additional reserves to transfer their allocations to those that do is readily available, using the IMF’s gold reserves.
Reorganizing the world order will need to extend beyond the financial system and involve the United Nations, especially membership of the Security Council.
That process needs to be initiated by the US, but China and other developing countries ought to participate as equals.
They are reluctant members of the Bretton Woods institutions, which are dominated by countries that are no longer dominant.
The rising powers must be present at the creation of this new system in order to ensure that they will be active supporters.
The system cannot survive in its present form, and the US has more to lose by not being in the forefront of reforming it.
The US is still in a position to lead the world, but, without far-sighted leadership, its relative position is likely to continue to erode.
It can no longer impose its will on others, as George W. Bush’s administration sought to do, but it could lead a cooperative effort to involve both the developed and the developing world, thereby reestablishing American leadership in an acceptable form.
The alternative is frightening, because a declining superpower losing both political and economic dominance but still preserving military supremacy is a dangerous mix.
We used to be reassured by the generalization that democratic countries seek peace.
After the Bush presidency, that rule no longer holds, if it ever did.
In fact, democracy is in deep trouble in America.
The financial crisis has inflicted hardship on a population that does not like to face harsh reality.
President Barack Obama has deployed the “confidence multiplier” and claims to have contained the recession.
But if there is a “double dip” recession, Americans will become susceptible to all kinds of fear mongering and populist demagogy.
If Obama fails, the next administration will be sorely tempted to create some diversion from troubles at home – at great peril to the world.
Obama has the right vision.
He believes in international cooperation, rather than the might-is-right philosophy of the Bush-Cheney era.
The emergence of the G-20 as the primary forum of international cooperation and the peer-review process agreed in Pittsburghare steps in the right direction.
What is lacking, however, is a general recognition that the system is broken and needs to be reinvented.
After all, the financial system did not collapse altogether, and the Obama administration made a conscious decision to revive banks with hidden subsidies rather than to recapitalize them on a compulsory basis.
Those institutions that survived will hold a stronger market position than ever, and they will resist a systematic overhaul.
Obama is preoccupied by many pressing problems, and reinventing the international financial system is unlikely to receive his full attention.
China’s leadership needs to be even more far-sighted than Obama is.
China is replacing the American consumer as the motor of the world economy.  Since it is a smaller motor, the world economy will grow slower, but China’s influence will rise very fast.
For the time being, the Chinese public is willing to subordinate its individual freedom to political stability and economic advancement.
But that may not continue indefinitely – and the rest of the world will never subordinate its freedom to the prosperity of the Chinese state.
As China becomes a world leader, it must transform itself into a more open society that the rest of the world is willing to accept as a world leader.  Military power relations being what they are, China has no alternative to peaceful, harmonious development.  Indeed, the future of the world depends on it.

A New Year of Global Conflict
DAVOS – In today’s world, identifying and managing hotspots is not simply a matter of pulling out a map, spotting the wildfires, and empowering diplomats to douse the flames.
To understand today’s major conflicts and confrontations, we must recognize important ways in which global political conditions enable them.
Conflicts are much more likely to arise or persist when those with the means to prevent or end them cannot or will not do so.
Unfortunately, this will be borne out in 2013.
In the United States, barring a foreign-policy crisis that directly threatens national security, President Barack Obama’s administration will focus most of its time, energy, and political capital on debt reduction and other domestic priorities.
In Europe, officials will continue their struggle to restore confidence in the eurozone.
And, in China, though the demands of economic growth and job creation will force the country’s new leaders to develop new ties to other regions, they are far too preoccupied with the complexities of economic reform to assume unnecessary costs and risks outside Asia.
That is why the world’s fires will burn longer and hotter this year.
This does not mean that the world’s powers will not inflict damage of their own.
Today, these governments are more likely to use drones and special forces to strike at their perceived enemies.
The world has grown used to US drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, but recent news reports suggest that China and Japan are also investing in unmanned aircraft – in part to enhance their leverage in disputes over islands in the East China Sea.
By lowering the costs and risks of attack, these technological innovations make military action more likely.
Perhaps the lowest-cost way to undermine rivals and attack enemies is to launch attacks in cyberspace.
That is why so many deep-pocketed governments – and some that are not so rich – are investing heavily in the technology and skills needed to enhance this capability.
This form of warfare is especially worrisome for two reasons.
First, unlike the structure of Cold War-era “mutually assured destruction,” cyber weapons offer those who use them an opportunity to strike anonymously.
Second, constant changes in technology ensure that no government can know how much damage its cyber-weapons can do or how well its deterrence will work until they use them.
As a result, governments now probe one another’s defenses every day, increasing the risk of accidental hostilities.
If John Kerry and Chuck Hagel are confirmed as US secretaries of state and defense, respectively, the Obama administration will feature two prominent skeptics of military intervention.
But high levels of US investment in drones, cyber-tools, and other unconventional weaponry will most likely be maintained.
These technological advances create the backdrop for the competition and rivalries roiling the two most important geopolitical hotspots.
In the Middle East, US and European officials will continue to resist deeper involvement in regional turmoil this year, leaving local powers – Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia – to vie for influence.
Confrontations between moderates and militants, and between Sunni and Shia factions, are playing out in several North African and Middle Eastern countries.
US officials have reason to believe that, over time, they will be able to worry less about the region and its problems.
According to current projections, technological innovations in unconventional energy will allow the US to meet more than 80% of its oil demand from sources in North and South America by 2020.
China, on the other hand, is set to become more dependent on Middle Eastern output.
Meanwhile, East Asia will remain a potential trouble spot in 2013.
Many of China’s neighbors fear that its ongoing economic and military expansion poses a growing threat to their interests and independence, and are reaching out to the US to diversify their security partnerships and hedge their bets on China’s benign intentions.
The US, eager to boost its economy’s longer-term prospects by engaging new trade partners in the world’s fastest-growing region, is shifting resources to Asia – though US (and European) policymakers would be wise to move forward with a transatlantic free-trade agreement as well.
There is a growing risk that the new Chinese leadership will interpret a heavier US presence in the region as an attempt to contain China’s rise and stunt its growth.
We have already seen a series of worrisome confrontations in the region, pitting China against Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea, and against Japan in the East China Sea.
While these disputes are unlikely to provoke military hostilities this year, the use of drones and cyber weapons remains a real threat.
The greatest risk for 2013 is large-scale economic conflict in Asia, which would not only harm the countries directly involved, but would also undermine global recovery.
The first shots in this battle have already been fired.
Last summer, disputes over a string of contested islands in the East China Sea led to a furious exchange of charges between China and Japan, the world’s second- and third-largest economies, respectively.
The two sides were never in danger of going to war, but Chinese officials allowed nationalist protests to develop into boycotts of Japanese products and acts of vandalism against Japanese companies.
Japan’s automobile exports to China fell 44.5%, and China’s imports from Japan fell nearly 10% – all in just one month.
That was a tough hit for a struggling Japanese economy.
It is also a clear warning to the rest of us that a fight need not involve troops, tanks, and rockets to exact a heavy price.
A New Year\u0027s Resolution
It is time for New Year's resolutions, and this year's are obvious.
When the millennium opened, world leaders pledged to seek peace, the end of poverty, and a cleaner environment.
Since then, the world has seen countless acts of violence, terrorism, famine, and environmental degradation.
In 2005, we can begin to change direction.
Knowledge, scientific advance, travel, and global communications give us many opportunities to find solutions for the world's great problems.
When a new disease called SARS hit China last year, the World Health Organization coordinated the actions of dozens of governments, and the crisis was quickly brought under control, at least for now.
When Bill Gates donated $1 billion to bring vaccines to poor children, he made it possible to protect tens of millions of young people from preventable diseases.
When an agricultural research unit called the World Agroforestry Center discovered that a certain tree could help African farmers grow more food, they introduced a new and valuable approach to overcoming Africa's chronic food crisis.
Unfortunately, such examples of international cooperation are as rare as they are impressive.
With our knowledge, science, and technology, the horrendous living conditions of the world's poorest people could be dramatically improved.
Millions of people could be spared malaria, HIV/AIDS, hunger, and life in slums.
The problem is not that we lack good solutions.
The problem is that we fail to cooperate globally to put those solutions into practice.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has honored me by making me his Special Adviser on the Millennium Development Goals and asking me to lead a group of scholars and development experts in identifying practical steps to reach the goals by the target date in 2015.
This effort, known as the UN Millennium Project, will issue its report to Secretary-General Annan on January 17, 2005.
Our study, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals , will be available for free around the world at www.unmillenniumproject.org .
What we learned is easily summarized.
For every major problem - hunger, illiteracy, malnutrition, malaria, AIDS, drought, and so forth - there are practical solutions that are proven and affordable.
These investments, in turn, would strengthen the private sector and economic growth.
Yet they require global partnership between the rich and poor countries of the world.
Most importantly, the world's richest countries need to do much more to help the poorest countries make use of modern science and technology to solve these great problems.
The US, for example, currently spends around $450 billion each year on its military, but less than $15 billion to help the world's poorest countries fight disease, educate their children, and protect the environment.
This is a mistake, because military approaches alone cannot make America safe.
Only shared prosperity can truly make the planet secure.
The US should be investing much more in peaceful economic development.
Germany, Japan, and several other rich countries are also doing much less than they should - and much less than they promised the poor countries that they would do.
In 2002, all donor countries committed to "make concrete efforts" to reach 0.7% of national income in development aid to poor countries.
Germany, Japan, and the US, among others, remain far below this commitment.
The year 2005 will offer many opportunities for citizens around the world to insist that their leaders keep their Millennium promises.
After our report is issued in January, Secretary-General Kofi Annan will issue a report to the world in the spring, identifying the practical steps that should be taken this year.
Around the same time, an important commission on Africa will issue a report to United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Then, in July, the UK will host the annual G-8 Summit of the rich countries.
Blair has promised that he will make the fight against poverty and long-term climate change the two priorities of the summit.
In September, the world's leaders will reconvene at the UN to decide on their actions during the coming decade.
The rich and powerful nations often declare their leadership in the world.
The US claims that it helps the world fight poverty, but instead spends its money on weapons.
Germany and Japan say that they want a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, but neither has yet followed through on its own pledges to help the world's poorest people.
The world's poorest countries will ask themselves why they should vote for Germany and Japan to have permanent seats on the Security Council if they can't keep their promises.
Nothing would be wiser for the world's rich countries than to fulfill their pledges to the world's poor, hungry and disease-ridden peoples.
Therein lies the path to sustained peace.
2005 is the year that words can become reality, and that the world can begin to fulfill its hopes for our new millennium.
Let us make our leaders aware that we aspire to shared peace and prosperity.
Let us pledge that the rich and powerful should take real actions to help the poor, the weak, and the suffering.
A No-Fly Zone for Libya
WASHINGTON, DC – Leaders around the world are vigorously debating the advisability of establishing a no-fly zone to stop the violence unfolding in Libya. Some cite Bosnia, where NATO took too long to protect civilian populations in the mid-1990’s, as a reason to act.
Others remember Rwanda, where President Bill Clinton later expressed regret for not acting to save innocent lives.
But the stakes in Libya today are more appropriately underscored by the tragedy in southern Iraq in the waning days of the Persian Gulf War 20 years ago.
As coalition forces were routing the Iraqi army in February 1991, President George H.W. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to “take matters into their hands to force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside.” When Iraqi Shiites, Kurds, and Marsh Arabs rebelled against Hussein, they believed that American forces would protect them against their brutal dictator’s superior firepower.
Instead, when Iraqi attack helicopters and elite troops began butchering their own people, coalition forces were ordered to stand down.
The world watched as thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered.
The situation in Libya today is not identical.
Inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt, the Libyan people rose up spontaneously against four decades of repression by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Still, the specter that haunts me is the same – ordinary people facing off against an autocrat’s airpower and well-armed soldiers, counting on the free world to protect them against massacre after we have applauded and bolstered their bravery with our words.
So far, Qaddafi’s forces have relied on airpower selectively.
But Qaddafi is shrewd.
My fear is that he is either choosing to bleed the opposition to death, rather than invite global action with a broad massacre, or waiting for the world to prove itself unwilling to act – at which point he might well begin killing civilians in large numbers.
We cannot wait for that to happen.
We need to take concrete steps now so that we are prepared to implement a no-fly zone immediately if Qaddafi starts using his airpower to kill large numbers of civilians.
Diplomacy is urgently needed to build broad support for a no-fly zone.
The most important imprimatur should come from the United Nations, where debate should begin immediately over a resolution authorizing a no-fly zone.
China and Russia have expressed reservations.
If the Security Council fails to authorize action, those of us determined to protect Libyan civilians will face a more difficult choice should the violence escalate.
So our diplomatic efforts must extend beyond the UN.
The support of NATO and the African Union are important.
To avoid the perception of NATO or the US attacking another Muslim country, the backing of the Arab world is also needed.
On that front, there are promising signs.
The six Arab countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have called for a UN-imposed no-fly zone. The Arab League has endorsed a similar proposal.
Muslim countries in particular should support preparations for intervention if the violence spirals out of control.
Qaddafi cannot be allowed to think that he can massacre his people with impunity.
And he cannot be free to make those attacks more lethal by using his airpower.
If the UN cannot approve a resolution for implementing a no-fly zone, then the US and its allies in NATO and the Arab world must be prepared to prevent a massacre like the one that occurred in Srebrenica in 1995, when more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were slaughtered.
Of course, imposing a no-fly zone would not be a panacea.
It probably would not tip the balance if the situation in Libya deteriorates into a full-scale civil war.
But a no-fly zone would eliminate airstrikes and save civilian lives.
It is a tool that we should be ready to use if the situation warrants it, and it would signal to the opposition that it is not alone.
Before that decision is reached, the international community needs to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies to the rebels in eastern Libya.
We must not allow them to be starved into submission.
The one option that should not be on the table is US ground troops; no one wants to see US forces bogged down in another war, especially in another Muslim country.
And, as President Barack Obama has said, the Libyan people must not be deprived of full ownership of their struggle for freedom, and Qaddafi must not be given a useful foil and scapegoat.
Perhaps the mere threat of a no-fly zone will keep Qaddafi’s pilots from using their helicopters and fighter jets to kill their own people.
If it does not, we should make clear that we will lead the free world to avoid the senseless slaughter of any more Libyan citizens by a madman bent on maintaining power.
The US and the world community should also make clear – as we did in Bosnia and Kosovo – that we are taking a united stand against a thug who is killing Muslims.
A No-Fly Zone for Syria
BRUSSELS – There is a saying, too often used in interpreting international relations, that my enemy’s enemy is my friend.
Sometimes it proves true; often it does not.
Thirty years ago, the Afghan mujahedin were mistaken for friends of the West when they fought their country’s Soviet invaders.
But how lazy that assumption seems now, given all that has since happened.
Syria’s deepening crisis, and the criminal use of chemical weapons there, has created a similar dynamic and dilemma.
But the West need not risk making the same mistake and accepting the same false choices.
Begin with first principles.
A chemical-weapons attack on the scale just seen in Syria must be deemed a game changer.
Although possessing these weapons of mass destruction is technically not illegal, most states are parties to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria has refused to sign.
So the answer to the question “What happens next?” cannot be “Nothing.”
Principles of international law – in particular, the emerging “responsibility to protect” doctrine and enforcement of the global ban on the use of chemical weapons – dictate that some form of military intervention must occur in order to deter others from using WMDs, particularly against civilians.
But which measures are appropriate and genuinely useful?
What is more likely to strengthen the West’s security, and what runs the risk of weakening it?
I believe that the fairest and simplest proportionate response would be to impose a no-fly zone on Syria.
The proposal is particularly appropriate in the likely absence of any resolution under United Nations Chapter VII (“Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace”), owing to the (almost certain) cynical use by Russia and China of their veto power in the Security Council.
Of course, claims and counter-claims have been swirling in the aftermath of the appalling chemical-weapons attack on a rebel-controlled area east of Damascus.
But, given the brutality of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, no one can doubt the lengths to which it would go to hide its guilt.
The five-day delay in allowing UN chemical-weapons experts to verify the attack gave Assad’s government ample time to conceal incriminating evidence, allow it to degrade, or destroy it with further shelling.
The United States, France, and the United Kingdom are adamant that all the intelligence and eyewitness evidence points to the Assad government as the perpetrator of the attack.
There also is no doubt about the legitimacy of concerns about elements of the Syrian opposition.
The Al Qaeda-led and Salafist extremist groups in the rebel forces, such a Al Nusra, have proved to be just as vicious as the government and its allies, the Iranian proxy Hezbollah and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.
But the united view of Western intelligence services is that there is no evidence that these rebel groups launched the chemical-weapons attack.
In these circumstances, a no-fly zone would not only clear the skies of Syrian warplanes and missiles, thereby reducing the scale of the slaughter; it would also show Assad and his supporters that he truly is vulnerable.
Generals ordered to use chemical weapons would have to reckon with the prospect that the regime could, actually, fall, and that they then might find themselves on trial for war crimes.
It would be better, of course, if Russia and China would allow the Security Council to do the job for which it was intended – securing peace and preventing war crimes.
By continuing to support Assad despite his use of chemical weapons, Russia’s standing in the Arab world has gone from patron to pariah.
What little moral and political standing Russian President Vladimir Putin has retained in the rest of the world is also evaporating, as he will soon discover at the upcoming G-20 Summit in Saint Petersburg.
But the world cannot hold its breath waiting for a change of heart by Putin and China, which is why a no-fly zone should be examined as a military option.
In the aftermath of the Gulf War in 1991, a no-fly zone, initially proposed by British Prime Minister John Major, did not topple Saddam Hussein, but it did prevent him from carrying out further attacks from the air on Kurds in the north and Shia in the south.
Likewise, a no-fly zone in Syria would immediately restrict the Syrian government’s means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction.
Some military experts may say that Syria’s air-defense systems are too sophisticated to suppress, making a no-fly zone too dangerous to enforce.
But Israel has managed to attack Syrian territory twice – destroying a North Korean-staffed nuclear reactor in 2007 and, more recently, striking a Hezbollah convoy – with no casualties or loss of planes.
Mindful of this weakness, Russia has offered Syria its more modern S-300 missiles; but there is no evidence that they have arrived, let alone been deployed.
And once Syria’s air-defense system is sufficiently degraded, it would be best if Arab countries – Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other Gulf states – and Turkey used their air forces to police the zone.
Any malicious wishful thinking on the part of Assad’s regime would be dispelled with every glance at the sky.
A Papal Success
LONDON – To the surprise of many in the media – at home and abroad – Pope Benedict XVI’s just completed visit to Britain was an outstanding success.
As a Roman Catholic and as the person asked by Prime Minister David Cameron to supervise government arrangements for the visit, I was naturally delighted.
But, I was also pleased from the point of view of a citizen, with a strong dislike of the herd mentality.
The media tends to move like market sentiment.
One moment, the public square is full of bulls; the next you’re being clawed by bears.
We were told before the visit that the British public would be at best indifferent and at worst hostile.
Even some in the Vatican feared this outcome.
But, from the moment that the Pope arrived in Scotland, he was overwhelmed by enthusiastic crowds of well-wishers, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.
I drove in the papal cavalcade along the motorway from Edinburgh, where Benedict met Queen Elizabeth, to Glasgow, where he celebrated an open-air mass.
All along the road were throngs of people.
From the first day, the media understood that they had badly misread the public mood.
The visit went from incipient disaster to huge success overnight.
The public had poked a sharp stick into the eye of metropolitan cynicism and know-all journalism.
The message conveyed by the pope and by the religious leaders with whom he met defied the contemporary assumption that the public cannot understand anything longer or more complicated than a sound bite.
The late American politician Adlai Stevenson once said that the average man (or woman) was a great deal better than average.
Voters should be treated as equals, and politicians should not talk down to them.
Mind you, this was not enough to win Stevenson the presidency in the 1950’s. “All the intelligent people in the country are supporting you,” he was told.
“That’s not enough,” he replied. “In order to win, I need a majority.”
Nevertheless, I think we have suffered too much from politics by simplistic slogans.
Making a coherent, well-argued case is surely the best way in the long-term of trying to mobilize consent for any course of action.
It dignifies an argument – and those to whom it is addressed – to set it out thoughtfully.
This is what Benedict does, as does his interlocutor in Britain, the head of the Anglican Communion, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury.
Both are intellectuals and address difficult questions in a quiet, carefully considered way. This has led Williams, in particular, into several run-ins with the media.
For example, he was widely criticized for a lecture in 2008 in which he spoke about the relationship between Islamic Sharia law and the British legal system.
What he said was both interesting and correct, but it was ripped out of context, and he was unfairly pilloried as a result.
The pope’s main speech was delivered to an audience of the great and the good in Westminster Hall, a medieval building whose use over the centuries has been intimately tied up with some of the greatest dramas in British history.
It was here that Thomas More, later canonized, was put on trial for defying his master, King Henry VIII.
More would not accept the king’s assertion of supremacy over the church.
His conscience would not allow him to bend to Henry’s will.
He was executed in the Tower of London, martyred because of his conscience.
St. Thomas More is regarded as the patron saint of politicians, which is rather flattering to many of those over whose spiritual interests he presumably presides.
After all, not every politician is widely commended for following his conscience.
But the story of More, and the fact that the British legal system in its early years evolved under the high wooden beams of Westminster Hall, gave Benedict a good hook on which to hang a sermon about the importance of ethics and religion in public life.
Many secularists argue that ever since the Enlightenment, reason has been enough to guide governance and policymaking, buttressed by the rule of law if a community is lucky.
But Benedict asserted the importance of faith alongside reason and law in safeguarding our civilization.
Europe’s foundations lie not just in Aristotle, reason, and classical Greece, and not just in Rome with its understanding of the importance of the law, but also in Jerusalem and the Abrahamic faith groups – Christian, Jewish, and Muslim.
Reason devoid of ethics can prove insufficient to support the survival of civilization, a point that the pope’s own homeland, Germany, discovered in the 1930’s.
To illustrate his argument, Benedict noted that the international financial crash, partly a consequence of insatiable greed, had provoked debate about the need for an ethical basis for economic behavior.
Have we forgotten so readily the repugnance with which we discovered the dishonesty and extravagance that helped to wreck our prosperity in the West?
Another example of the relationship between ethics and policy is the response that rich countries have made to global social inequity, a deep moral affront to everyone with even a modicum of conscience and sensibility.
In the midst of a gloomy crisis for public spending in Britain, the government has committed itself to sticking to its pledge of spending 0.7% of GDP on development assistance in poor countries.
If only others would do the same, like rich Italy, which spends only 0.15% of its GDP on overseas aid.
So Benedict set off a serious debate in Britain and beyond.
Where can and should religion and ethics contribute to our political discourse?
That is a central issue, and not just for Europe.
A Partnership in Peril
The Iraq war divided "old" and "new" Europe and imposed unprecedented strains on the relationship between America and Europe.
For nearly 60 years, the Atlantic partnership has been a force for good, not only for Europe and North America, but for the world.
Are these ties beyond repair, or can they be restored?
Relations disintegrated alarmingly fast.
In the aftermath of September 11th, even French newspapers carried headlines reading "We are all Americans."
It began to seem as though our fundamentally common outlook and our much-vaunted shared values had reasserted themselves.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Within a year, everything looked different, especially in Germany.
The transatlantic partnership once was a basic tenet of German foreign policy--and yet Germany's Chancellor won re-election on what was seen as an anti-American platform.
Although some of this sentiment was misrepresented, Germany clearly would not support military action in Iraq.
Many Germans remain torn not only about Iraq, but about war in general.
Many believe that Germany's stance represents pacifist, rather than anti-American, sentiment.
They may be right.
Germany has changed over the last decade, sending peacekeeping troops to Somalia, Bosnia, East Timor, Kosovo, the Caucasus, Macedonia and, in response to September 11th, Afghanistan.
But none of those troops has fought a war.
A closer look at the problem suggests that the division over Iraq is not merely an isolated incident, but reflects a range of deep-seated difficulties.
The list of issues on which Europe and America now hold deeply different views is longer than it has been in a generation.
There is discord on defence, with growing irritation in the US over what it views as the pretentious posturing of the so-called European Defence Initiative.
The US sees falling European defence budgets accompanied by new and unnecessary command structures, which merely duplicate the command structure that exists within NATO.
On the Middle East, a difference in emphasis has become a yawning gulf.
Trade disputes fester.
Differences on global environmental policy are acute, with America in the dock over its refusal to sign the Kyoto accord.
Cultural divisions are also more intense.
Many Europeans regard the use of capital punishment in the US as backward and repugnant.
Many Americans ascribe Europe's lack of total commitment to its anti-terrorism cause to latent anti-Semitism.
In Europe, there is a move towards greater integration, though some Europeans, especially the British, are divided on its desirability.
Some integration advocates see a united Europe as a strong partner of the US.
Others are motivated by a desire to set up a rival power center, however unrealistic this appears to be.
Some commentators have begun pointing to the different views of the US and Europe on the role of international law, as opposed to the use of force, in resolving disputes.
Because Europe is militarily insignificant, they argue, it is not surprising that Europeans emphasize diplomacy, rather than military might, to resolve disputes.
On the other hand, no one should be surprised that Americans chafe at constraints on their ability to take advantage of US military hegemony.
The truth is that transatlantic differences have existed for a long time.
During the Cold War, they were largely suppressed in the face of the Soviet threat and Europeans' recognition of their need of the US to meet that threat.
Indeed, it is somewhat surprising that the partnership did not show more strains sooner after the Cold War ended.
These strains are not helped by negativism on both sides of the Atlantic.
Although the US and Europe do have issues to resolve, there is a real danger that the portrayal of every possible event as heralding a new split will end up being self-fulfilling.
Too much is at stake to allow this to go on.
Europe and North America do retain a fundamental common outlook.
If they work together, more progress can be made in tackling the world's problems than if they see each global flashpoint as an opportunity to seek advantage at the other's expense.
If, on the contrary, the Atlantic partnership disintegrates into rivalry or hostility, the world will become more dangerous.
What is to be done?
If the political will is there, the partnership can be preserved and sustained.
This means that decision-makers, on both sides of the Atlantic, should always take into account the effect of their decisions (and of their language) on the relationship.
Of course, this cannot always be decisive.
But if it is always regarded as relevant, the worst damage may be avoided.
One specific suggestion is that governments, on both sides of the Atlantic, set up a Standing Conference of senior officials to identify potential problems before they become sources of difficulty.
Forewarned is forearmed, and early action might diffuse problems which would otherwise become intractable.
In a new, unstable century, the relationship between Europe and America is more important than ever.
Arguments, like the one over Iraq, should not sound the relationship's death knell, but must be managed in such a way as to inflict the minimum of harm on the partnership.
Every effort must be made to ensure that future disagreements, which will undoubtedly arise, do less damage.
Too much is at stake to allow Atlantic partnership to flounder.
A Path through Europe’s Minefield
LONDON – Earlier this week, a group of almost 100 prominent Europeans delivered an open letter to the leaders of all 17 eurozone countries.
The letter said, in so many words, what the leaders of Europe now appear to have understood: they cannot go on “kicking the can down the road.”
And, just as importantly, they now understand that it is not enough to ensure that governments can finance their debt at reasonable interest rates; they must also address the weakness of Europe’s banking system.
Indeed, Europe’s banking and sovereign-debt problems are mutually self-reinforcing.
The decline in government bond prices has exposed the banks’ undercapitalization, while the prospect that governments will have to finance banks’ recapitalization has driven up risk premiums on government bonds.
Facing the prospect of having to raise additional capital at a time when their shares are selling at a fraction of book value, banks have a powerful incentive to reduce their balance sheets by withdrawing credit lines and shrinking their loan portfolios.
Europe’s leaders are now contemplating what to do, and their next move will have fateful consequences, either calming the markets or driving them to new extremes.
All agree that Greece needs an orderly restructuring, because a disorderly default could cause a eurozone meltdown.
But, when it comes to the banks, I am afraid that the eurozone’s leaders are contemplating some inappropriate steps.
Specifically, they are talking about recapitalizing the banking system, rather than guaranteeing it.
And they want to do it on a country-by-country basis, rather than on the basis of the eurozone as a whole.
There is a good reason for this: Germany does not want to pay for recapitalizing French banks.
But, while Chancellor Angela Merkel is justified in insisting on this, it is driving her in the wrong direction.
Let me stake out more precisely the narrow path that would allow Europe to pass through this minefield.
The banking system needs to be guaranteed first, and recapitalized later.
Governments cannot afford to recapitalize the banks now; it would leave them with insufficient funds to deal with the sovereign-debt problem.
It will cost much less to recapitalize the banks after the crisis has abated and both government bonds and bank shares have returned to more normal levels.
Governments can, however, provide a credible guarantee, given their power to tax.
A new, legally binding agreement – not a change to the Lisbon Treaty (which would encounter too many hurdles), but a new agreement – will be needed for the eurozone to mobilize that power, and such an accord will take time to negotiate and ratify.
But, in the meantime, governments can call upon the European Central Bank, which the eurozone member states already fully guarantee on a pro rata basis.
In exchange for a guarantee, the eurozone’s major banks would have to agree to abide by the ECB’s instructions.
This is a radical step, but a necessary one under the circumstances.
Acting at the behest of the member states, the ECB has sufficient powers of persuasion: it could close its discount window to the banks, and the governments could seize institutions that refuse to cooperate.
The ECB would then instruct the banks to maintain their credit lines and loan portfolios while strictly monitoring the risks they take for their own account.
This would remove one of the two main driving forces of the current market turmoil.
The ECB could deal with the other driving force, the lack of financing for sovereign debt, by lowering its discount rate, encouraging distressed governments to issue treasury bills, and encouraging the banks to subscribe (an idea I owe to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa).
The T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time, making them tantamount to cash; but, as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB, the banks would find it advantageous to hold them.
Governments could meet their financing needs within agreed limits at very low cost during this emergency period, and the ECB would not violate Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty.
These measures would be sufficient to calm markets and bring the acute phase of the crisis to an end.
Recapitalization of the banks should wait until then; only the holes created by restructuring the Greek debt would have to be filled immediately.
In conformity with Germany’s demand, the additional capital would come first from the market and then from individual governments – and from the European Financial Stability Facility only as a last resort, thereby preserving the EFSF’s firepower.
A new agreement for the eurozone, negotiated in a calmer atmosphere, should not only codify the practices established during the emergency, but also lay the groundwork for an economic-growth strategy.
During the emergency period, fiscal retrenchment and austerity are unavoidable; but, in the longer term, the debt burden will become unsustainable without growth – and so will the European Union itself.
A Pax Mafiosa in Mexico?
MEXICO CITY -- The recent killing of Ignacio Coronel Villarreal, a boss of the Sinaloa drug gang, by Mexican special forces is but the latest high profile killing in an increasingly violent campaign.&#160; But is a strategy of killing off Mexico’s drug kingpins really viable? &#160;
Mexico’s government has several options for ending the violence of narcotics-related organized crime that is devastating the country and corrupting and weakening its political system.
Only two are advisable, but they are not easy to apply and success is not guaranteed.
Three years ago, President Felipe Calderón decided to deploy the armed forces in several states where the main drug gangs are established.
Calderón is trying to check the gangs’ capacity for violence and diminish their economic resources, but he still has not been able to implement a plan that is both successful and minimizes the cost in lives.
The country’s two biggest drug gangs, the Sinaloa and Tamaulipas organizations, were once rivals, but are now allied against their former partners – the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, Beltrán-Leyva, and Zetas organizations – which appeared during Mexico’s long period of one-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Created in 1929, the PRI lost the country’s presidency for the first time in 2000.
Since then, two parallel transitions have been taking place: one toward democracy, and the other, in the field of drug trafficking, toward a paramilitary/mafioso framework.
It was the Tamaulipas organization that began the latter transition at the end of the 1990’s.
A regional presence corrupting local politicians, it soon expanded its territory and gained control of key positions in municipal and state security institutions.
This was accompanied by an increase in armed violence against the police, the military, and journalists, as well as by incursions into politics and diversification of criminal income through kidnappings, extortion, piracy, and human trafficking.
Paradoxically, the PRI’s loss of its monopoly on political power and the opening of Mexican politics facilitated and accelerated this process.
Parties without pacts, consensus, or a shared vision were made co-responsible in matters of national security, which enhanced the influence of the drug gangs.
None of the areas where illicit drugs are produced, smuggled into the country, and transported into the United States are insulated from drug related-corruption.
Indeed, corruption, including “protection” of traffickers, is distributed along the lines of party control in various regions.
The historical subordination of criminal to political power is being undone.
During the 2010 elections in Tamaulipas, a candidate for governor and another one for mayor were assassinated, presumably by “organized crime.”
Other candidates received death threats.
In Chihuahua, candidates for office claimed to have received threats, and some asked for police protection.
In Tamaulipas, the Golfo and Zetas gangs, former partners, are fighting to the death.
And in Chihuahua, the state with the highest number of murders in the country, powerful gangs that were once united are now in open confrontation.
The PRI retained power in those states: voters did not make them pay for their share of responsibility for the violence.
But more than 60% of voters stayed away from the polls.
Mexico’s political class has at least six options in the fight against the narcotics traffickers:
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Do nothing and let the drug gangs impose their lawlessness on society;
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Make anti-drug policy the exclusive concern of the federal government;
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Form a strategic partnership with the traffickers in the hope that they keep to a “gentleman’s agreement” and commit themselves to lowering the level of violence and avoiding confrontations with police and the military.
This means granting them formal political recognition and acceding to widening the pax mafiosa that already exists in many local jurisdictions;
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Provide support for partial continuation of Calderón’s strategy, including cooperation agreed with the US to combat transnational organized crime.
US financing will need to be continued, and probably increased, to combat the traffic in illegal drugs, organized crime, and related violence;
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Create a partnership between political parties join and the federal government to design a national security policy, consolidate law-enforcement institutions, and impose authority throughout the national territory against all illegal armed groups;
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Radically alter Mexico’s drug policy by legalizing drugs and assuming the consequences in the United Nations and in relations with the US.
Despite the increasingly desperate violence, there is nothing to indicate that Mexico’s political class is even prepared to consider the sixth option.
At present, versions of the other options can be seen.
Achieving the fourth, along with social and economic measures aimed at creating better jobs and improving people’s standard of living, would at least make it possible to weaken, contain, and control Mexico’s drug trafficking organizations, thereby strengthening civil order and governability.
A Pivot to the People
PRINCETON – On February 1, the United Nations Security Council met to consider the Arab League’s proposal to end the violence in Syria.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton represented the United States.
Midway through her remarks, she began speaking not to the Syrian ambassador, who was in the room, or even the Syrian government, but directly to the Syrian people.
She said that change in Syria would require Syrians of every faith and ethnicity to work together, protecting and respecting the rights of minorities.
Addressing those minorities, she continued: “We do hear your fears, and we do honor your aspirations. Do not let the current regime exploit them to extend this crisis.”
She told Syria’s business, military, and other leaders that they must recognize that their futures lie with the state, not with the regime. “Syria belongs to its 23 million citizens, not to one man or his family.”
Speaking directly to citizens – seeing a country’s people, as well as its government – is not just a rhetorical device.
While many foreign-policy pundits have focused on the US “pivot to Asia,” Clinton has also executed a less-publicized, but no less important, pivot to the people.
She has introduced policies, programs, and institutional reforms designed to support government-to-society and society-to-society diplomacy, alongside traditional government-to-government relations.
These initiatives do not get headlines, but they will gradually transform much of American foreign policy.
In January, the State Department unveiled a new “super-office” of Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, under the leadership of Under-Secretary Maria Otero.
The office brings together agencies that focus on international law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and reconstruction and stabilization with those charged with advancing democracy, human rights, and humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants.
Otero explains the logic behind the initiative in terms of “protecting individuals.”
That, in turn, requires “not just engaging state to state,” but also working “with players and actors outside of the traditional [channels] we’ve engaged in.”
Viewed from this perspective, countering terrorism includes rebutting terrorist propaganda with a strategic communications campaign.
Countering narco-gang violence includes working with Mexican telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim to develop tools that allow ordinary citizens to report violence anonymously by text message and enable police to map the results.
Strengthening democracy means working with the Kenyan developers of a crisis-mapping platform that allows anyone with a cell phone to text information about election fraud or violence to a central monitoring station.
On a country-by-country basis, pivoting to the people means engaging with Egypt’s bloggers as well as with the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces; convening young entrepreneurs in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco and connecting them to funding and mentoring; and using social media in Russia to rebut government efforts to smear the US ambassador.
And, working at an official level, it means co-sponsoring with Brazil the Open Government Partnership, which brings together governments committed to increasing transparency, accountability, and citizen participation, and uses mutual peer pressure and open reporting to hold them to their commitments.
Thinking about countries in these comprehensive terms also provides a different strategic perspective.
Clinton has created a raft of new positions at the State Department to spur outreach to different social segments.
The strategies and programs developed by the Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, the Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues, the Senior Adviser for Civil Society and Emerging Democracies, the Special Representative for Outreach to Muslim Communities, the Special Representative for Global Partnerships, and the Special Representative for Commercial and Business Affairs often present a very different face of the US.
As a result, Clinton has launched an actual strategic dialogue with civil society.
For example, Ambassador Melanne Verveer has attended more than 1,000 events around the world focused on empowering women in areas ranging from peace negotiations to farming.
Similarly, she has launched programs such as mWomen, designed to expand and support mobile technology that increases women’s independence, security, and access to health care and vital knowledge.
The Office of Global Youth Affairs is building a local youth council at every US embassy around the world, to advise and help to implement embassy programming aimed at local youth.
Much of the programming aimed at youth, women, entrepreneurs, diasporas, technologists, and other social groups is partly funded and conducted by the private sector.
Indeed, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy mentions “public-private partnerships” more than 30 times.
Clinton created the Global Partnership Initiative to build as many coalitions, networks, and partnerships as possible with corporations, foundations, NGOs, universities, and other civic organizations.
Here, the pivot to the people includes the American people: the dynamism, creativity, and resources of American business and non-profit organizations already engaged around the world.
One privately-funded initiative spearheaded by the State Department will send 300 dogwood trees to Japan this spring, to be planted in the tsunami-affected region and in Tokyo to express the American people’s support for the Japanese people; another will send English teachers throughout Southeast Asia.
After participating in the Friends of Syria conference in Tunis, Clinton convened a town hall meeting with Tunisian youth.
In her opening remarks, she told her audience that “young people are at the heart of today’s great strategic opportunities and challenges.” Speaking about her lifetime efforts to put “women’s empowerment on the international agenda,” she added, “It’s time to put youth empowerment there as well.”
The implications of all of this activity, which Clinton calls “twenty-first-century statecraft,” are profound.
From now on, US diplomatic relations with other countries will engage directly with their people and connect them to the American people as much as possible.
From the perspective of US diplomats, the people of every country stand on the same footing as their government.
That assumption is the heart of democracy; it is a revolution for diplomacy.
A Post-Nuclear Euro-Atlantic Security Order
WASHINGTON, DC – As we enter 2011, the Euro-Atlantic region is a study in strategic contrasts.
Over the past 20 years, no geo-political space has undergone as dramatic a transformation as that between the Atlantic and the Urals.
In our lifetimes, we have seen a welcome change from the darkest days of the Cold War, when a devastating conventional and nuclear war in Europe was a real possibility, to a new era in which no state faces this type of existential threat.
But, despite these positive developments, the two largest powers in the region – the United States and Russia – each still possesses thousands of nuclear weapons, accounting for more than 90% of the world’s nuclear inventory.
Many of these weapons remain deployed or designed for use within the Euro-Atlantic region.
Reduction and elimination of this Cold War-era nuclear infrastructure is the largest piece of unfinished business from that bygone time.
The continuing existence of large strategic nuclear forces deployed on high alert, and of tactical nuclear weapons deployed in certain NATO states and Russia, creates a risk of accidental, unauthorized, or mistaken use, and of terrorist groups acquiring these assets.
So security vigilance is essential.
To meet this challenge, the three of us – building on the action plan adopted by consensus at the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference – have endorsed a series of urgent, practical steps towards the long-term goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.
These include:
·        increasing assured warning and decision times for the launch of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles;
·        developing cooperative missile-defense and early-warning systems;
·        ensuring the highest possible standards of security for nuclear weapons and materials;
·        beginning a dialogue on tactical nuclear weapons involving Russia, the US, and NATO;
·        adopting a process to bring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into effect;
·        developing international and multilateral approaches to manage the risks of fuel production for civilian nuclear power; and
·        further reductions in US and Russian nuclear forces.
As former US Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former US Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, former US Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, and former US Senator Sam Nunn put it in 2007, “Without the bold vision [of a nuclear weapons-free world], the actions will not be perceived as fair or urgent.
Without the actions, the vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible.”
Perhaps the most crucial step toward realizing this vision is to redouble our efforts to resolve regional confrontations and conflicts that give rise to new nuclear powers.
The great swath of states stretching from North America across Europe through Russia has a vital role to play in stabilizing an increasingly fragmented and stressed international order.
These states can play this role, however, only if first they transform this geographic space into a genuinely inclusive and vibrant security community.
Failing that (and we are failing today) the Euro-Atlantic states and their organizations will settle for suboptimal – and too often utterly inadequate – responses to the twenty-first century’s security challenges, including the threat of nuclear proliferation.
Lately, several national leaders, including the Russian and US presidents and NATO secretary-general, have embraced the idea of a Euro-Atlantic security community, and begun stressing the importance of fashioning a stronger and more inclusive European security order.
The timing could not be better, as the Euro-Atlantic family has entered a critical period.
On November 19-20, NATO heads of states approved a new “strategic concept” to guide the organization for the next decade At the same time Russian President D. Medvedev and his NATO counterparts issued a joint statement, endorsing the first Joint Review of 21st Century Common Security Challenges and deciding to resume Threat Missile Defence Cooperation.
Two weeks later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) heads of state assembled in Astana, Kazakhstan, to help shape the OSCE’s next stage of development.
Joint action on nuclear-threat reduction must be a critical element in moving the Euro-Atlantic nations toward a level of stability and strength and allow them to exercise badly needed global leadership.
Achieving a genuinely collaborative approach to missile-defense matters will address a common threat and help remove misgivings that are blocking progress toward a common security space.
Similarly, the Euro-Atlantic states can mobilize behind efforts to strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency’s safeguards system, which ensures the non-diversion of peaceful nuclear programs, in order to foster cooperation on countering the threat of nuclear terrorism, and to develop new mechanisms to protect jointly critical infrastructure from cyber attack.
Such actions are crucial to these states’ national security and global efforts to mitigate threats.
Pursuing arrangements that increase warning and decision-making time for all countries in the Euro-Atlantic region would introduce stability into the NATO-Russia relationship.
Adjustments in operational doctrine, as applied to strategic, tactical, and conventional forces, would constitute a giant step toward ending the relationship’s militarized framework.
This is only a partial list of what must be done if governments are serious about building a stronger, inclusive European security order, one where the roles and risks of nuclear weapons are reduced, and ultimately eliminated.
The three of us are working with a distinguished group from all corners of the Euro-Atlantic region to develop these and other concrete steps that are essential to creating a genuine security community, including its economic, energy, and environmental dimensions.
NATO, OSCE, and other key regional institutions must give this concept and process their essential support.
A President in the Dock
NEW YORK – In a way, the stir aroused by the decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to indict Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur is a surprise.
After all, the Court has no means of its own to arrest anyone in Sudan, much less a head of state who commands the country’s armed forces.
Nor is there any prospect that someone else will intervene in Sudan to make an arrest.
While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
But it could.
Despite the ICC’s seeming powerlessness, many governments’ leaders are engaged in strenuous efforts to block the indictment.
They do not seem concerned that the charges are unfair; rather, they appear to be demonstrating solidarity with a fellow head of state. 
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Those denouncing the attempt to put Bashir on trial include the large blocs of countries that are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the African Union, together with such powerful states as China and Russia.
One can only guess whether some of those joining this effort are motivated by concern that they themselves may some day face charges like those leveled at Bashir by the ICC judges.
Though Bashir may be able to avoid arrest simply by limiting his international travel, the commotion provoked by the indictment is not irrational.
The charges against him have a powerful stigmatizing effect.
The fact that a panel of judges representing the 108 governments that are parties to the ICC has accused Bashir of principal responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur during the past six years undermines the legitimacy of his continued rule.
Those crimes have caused more than 300,000 deaths, and have forcibly displaced at least another 2.7 million people.
Even if Bashir’s fellow heads of state succeed in their effort to persuade the United Nations Security Council to defer prosecution – which is highly unlikely – the charges will continue to hang over Bashir’s head unless and until he stands trial.
In 1999, an international criminal tribunal indicted another sitting head of state, Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Though he seemed secure at the time, a year and a half later he was sent to The Hague to stand trial.
Similarly, in 2003, an international criminal tribunal indicted Liberia’s then president, Charles Taylor.
He had to flee Liberia a few months later and initially received asylum in Nigeria, but is now on trial in The Hague.
When those indictments were issued, no one could have predicted how events would unfold; in retrospect, it is evident that the indictments’ delegitimizing effects had important consequences.
Of course, the ICC’s prosecutor and judges are themselves taking a substantial risk in the indictment of Bashir.
The Court is still in its infancy, and antagonizing the many government leaders expressing solidarity with him could jeopardize its future. 
Yet it should be recognized that the Court’s personnel are carrying out their duties.
The treaty establishing the ICC explicitly states that heads of state do not enjoy immunity.
And the Security Council referred the Darfur case to the Court in 2005.
This was an investigation that had to be conducted, and those found to have the highest level of responsibility for the crimes had to be indicted.
Many of those now objecting to the prosecution of Bashir participated in the decisions leading to the indictment.
If the ICC’s indictment now causes them discomfort, that is only because they did not anticipate that the Court would carry out the responsibilities that they themselves assigned to it.
A Primer for Pandemics
A few times each year, the world is reminded that a pandemic threat is immanent.
In 2003, it was SARS.
Today, it is a potential avian virus similar to the one that killed 30 million people after 1914.
“Bird flu” has already shown that it can jump from fowl to humans, and now even to cats, which indicates that it might be the next global killer.
But there are many other potential pandemics, and many are not even viruses.
Bacteria, prions, parasites, and even environmental factors could suddenly change in a way that slays us.
It is widely predicted that when this happens, the economic and human losses will exceed that of any previous war.
Indeed, it is humbling to remember that some of history’s most deadly invasions were carried out by single-cell organisms, such as cholera, bubonic plague, and tuberculosis. Countries with the resources to do so are making resistance plans against pandemics – limited strategies that would protect their own citizens.
Most governments are hoping that early detection will make containment possible.
Containment depends heavily on vaccines, but vaccines are only part of the answer.
While they are a good defense against many viruses, each vaccine is highly specific to the threat.
Viruses are parasites to cells, and each virus attacks a particular type of cell.
The virus is shaped so that it can drill into a particular feature of that cell and inject parts of itself inside, confusing the cell into making more viruses and destroying itself in the process. With their very specific forms, the most effective anti-viral vaccines must be designed for a narrow range of factors.
Sometimes the tailored nature of viruses works in our favor.
For example, they usually find it difficult to jump between species, because they would have to change their structure.
But if large numbers of a host – say, birds – encounter a great number of people, eventually the virus will find a way to prosper in a new type of cell.
Birds are the greatest concern today only because the spread is easy to see.
But AIDS jumped from monkeys and several types of flu jumped from swine.
Deadly mutations of any kind need to be identified urgently, so that an effective vaccine can be designed before the strain becomes comfortable in the human body.
Unfortunately our present methods of detection are not sensitive enough.
This is even more worrying when you realize that scientists should also be monitoring bacteria, prions, and parasites.
There are more bacteria than any other life form.
Many live harmlessly in our bodies and perform useful functions.
They evolve and adapt easily, which means that they learn to sidestep our drugs over time. Bacteria should be checked for two types of mutation: adaptation by a hostile form that enables it to become super-immune to drugs, or a deadly mutant strain that appears in one of the multitude of “safe” bacteria.
Prions are a relatively new discovery.
They are made from proteins similar to those that the body uses during healthy operations, which means that they are able to fool the body’s tools into making more prions.
They have only recently been recognized as the cause of several infectious diseases, including mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which kill by crowding out healthy brain cells.
Many nerve, respiratory and muscle diseases might also be caused by prions.
Finally, parasites, simple animals that infect us, are already classified as pandemics.
Malaria afflicts 300 million people and is the world’s biggest killer of children.
Many parasites are worms: hookworm (800 million people infected), roundworm (1.5 billion), schistosomes (200 million), and the worm that causes Elephantiasis (150 million).
There are also antagonists that are currently ignored.
Environmental chemicals and particulates might warrant their own categories.
Or consider combinations of problems, such as these chemical infectors mixing with airborne pollens, and apparently pushing up incidences of asthma.
New fungal infections are even scarier and might be harder to treat.
The bottom line is that we can’t predict where the threat will emerge, so we need a distributed, intelligent detection system.
In practical terms, how should it be built?
“Detectors” would have to be expert enough to know when an ordinary-looking symptom is actually an emergency.
They would be located everywhere, with an emphasis on vulnerable regions.
Initial warning signs of a pandemic are most likely to appear in the developing world, but detection nodes should be positioned in every country, with the least possible expense.
This is not as difficult as it sounds.
The key is to harness existing infrastructure.
Medical infrastructure exists everywhere, in some form.
It also tends to be the least corrupt of institutions in regions where that is a problem.
Medical centers and clinics would be expected to investigate the cause of ailments in a large number of their patients, even in cases where the symptoms seem common.
A small amount of additional scientific expertise and lab equipment would need to be added to a public health system that serves ordinary needs.
Enhancing existing resources would be effective for two reasons.
First, illness is more likely to be reported in a city hospital than at a specialist institute.
Second, the investment would boost latent public health in that region.
For poor regions, investment in equipment and training would have to come from wealthier counterparts.
Rich countries could justify the expense in terms of the savings that would result from early detection of a major threat.
Tropical climates and urban slums are humanity’s front line against pandemics, and they should be equipped properly.
Public health is an important asset for any nation. With so much at stake, it makes sense to place sentinels near every swamp, city, public market, and farmyard on earth.
A Prisoner’s Christmas
LUKYANIVSKA PRISON, KYIV – It has been said that there are no atheists in a foxhole.
Here, after my show trial and four and a half months in a cell, I have discovered that there are no atheists in prison, either.
When, despite unbearable pain, you are interrogated – including in your cell – for dozens of hours without a break, and an authoritarian regime’s entire system of coercion, including its media, is trying to discredit and destroy you once and for all, prayer becomes the only intimate, trusting, and reassuring conversation that one can have.
God, one realizes, is one’s only friend and only available family, because – deprived even of access to a trusted priest – there is no one else in whom to confide one’s worries and hopes.
In this season of love and family, the loneliness of a prison cell is almost unbearable.
The gray, dead silence of night (guards peer in voyeuristically through a slot in the door), the sudden, disembodied shrieks of prisoners, shrieks of distress and rage, the distant rattles and clangs of prison bolts: all make sleep impossible, or so restless as to be a torment.
But what is strange is that your senses are not dulled by this dead and dreadful world.
On the contrary, they are ignited by it: your mind is set free from mundane concerns to ponder the inestimable and your place within it – a freedom of spirit that is a truly unexpected gift this Christmas season.
In the cell’s darkness, I gather strength and hope from the fact that God somehow seems so near to me here.
For where else would Christ be but with those who suffer and are persecuted?
Indeed, I have recently been reading Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s sublime and challenging Letters from Prison, in which he yearns for a Christ capable of offering mercy to a world, our world, then in the process of being martyred for a single man.
Written in a cramped, dank, and putrid cell, where hope was meant to die before the body, Bonhoeffer crafted a book rich in faith, openness, possibility, and, yes, hope – even in humanity’s darkest hour.
One particular passage resonates with me as I contemplate Ukraine’s plight.
As he awaited his approaching execution by the Nazis, Bonhoeffer wrote that, in prison, “the godlessness of the world is not...concealed but, rather, revealed, and is thus exposed to an unexpected light.”
So I take some comfort this Christmas in knowing that the godlessness, inhumanity, and criminality of the regime that is now ruling in Kyiv is, at long last, being exposed to the world in a clear light.
Its democratic posturing has been unmasked as cynical political theater, its claim to desire a European future for Ukraine’s people revealed to be a lie, and the rapaciousness of its kleptocrats has been laid bare.
The regime’s contempt for the constitution and the rule of law is now undeniable, and that clarity is empowering.
More importantly, the suffering of Ukraine’s people has also become more widely known, and we are no longer so alone in our plight.
Alleviating it has been embraced as a just cause across Europe and around the world.
The everyday oppression, stifled media, and shakedowns and extortion of businesses for bribes all point to a mafia state on Europe’s border.
Now our European friends can no longer deny the smug vileness of the regime with which they are forced to deal.
And I am thankful this Christmas for being able to believe that democratic Europe will not tolerate this state of affairs.
Ukrainians will be strong knowing that they are not alone in their fight.
I do not pretend to be an expert on religious faith and spiritual values.
I am only a believer who cannot accept that our existence is the result of some freak cosmic accident.
We are, I believe, part of a mysterious yet integral act, whose source, direction, and purpose, though difficult to grasp at times, does have meaning and purpose – even when one is confined behind prison bars.
It is only faith in the idea that our lives matter, and that our decisions must be judged by their moral content, that we in Ukraine, and elsewhere, will be able to find our way out of the misery, unhappiness, and despair that has consumed us over the last two years.
It is within our power to recover or reinvigorate our freedoms and our societies, not by individual efforts, but by joining forces with likeminded people all over the world.
I know that we will manage this.
This Christmas, I ask my family and friends everywhere not to worry about me.
As Anna Akhmatova, the great poetic chronicler of Stalin’s terror, said, “I am alive in this grave.” Indeed, I am more alive, I know, than the men who have imprisoned me here.
Christmas is meant to mark the possibility of a new beginning for all men and women.
As Bonhoeffer affirmed with his last words: “This is for me...the beginning of life.”
A Private Affair?
Can a public figure have a private life?
Recent events in three countries have highlighted the importance of this question.
In the French presidential election, both candidates tried to keep their domestic life separate from their campaign.
Ségolène Royal is not married to François Hollande, the father of her four children.
When asked whether they were a couple, Royal replied, “Our lives belong to us.”
Similarly, in response to rumors that President-elect Nicholas Sarkozy’s wife had left him, a spokesman for Sarkozy said, “That’s a private matter.”
The French have a long tradition of respecting the privacy of their politicians’ personal lives, and French public opinion is more broad-minded than in the United States, where an unwed mother of four would have no chance of being nominated for the presidency by a major party.
Indeed, last month, Randall Tobias, the top foreign aid adviser in the US State Department, resigned after acknowledging that he had used an escort service described as providing “high-end erotic fantasy” – although Tobias said he only had a massage.
In Britain, Lord John Browne, the chief executive who transformed BP from a second-tier European oil company into a global giant, resigned after admitting he had lied in court about the circumstances in which he had met a gay companion (apparently, he met him through a male escort agency).
In resigning, he said that he had always regarded his sexuality as a personal matter, and he was disappointed that a newspaper – The Mail on Sunday – had made it public.
Candidates for public office, and those holding high administrative or corporate positions, should be judged on their policies and performance, not on private acts that are irrelevant to how well they carry out, or will carry out, their public duties.
Sometimes, of course, the two overlap. The Mail on Sunday and its sister paper, The Daily Mail, justified their publication of revelations by Browne’s former companion on the grounds that they include allegations that Browne had allowed him to use corporate resources for the benefit of his own private business.
The company denied that there was any substance to these allegations.
As the administrator of the US Agency for International Development, Tobias implemented the Bush administration’s policy that requires organizations working against HIV/AIDS to condemn prostitution if they are to be eligible for US assistance.
That policy has been criticized for making it more difficult to assist sex workers who are at high risk of contracting and spreading HIV/AIDS.
Arguably, the public has an interest in knowing if those who implement such policies are themselves paying for sexual services.
Where there is no suggestion that a matter of personal morality has had an impact on the performance of a business executive or government official, we should respect that person’s privacy.
But what about candidates for political leadership?
Since politicians ask us to entrust them with sweeping powers, it can be argued that we should know as much as possible about their morality.
For example, we might reasonably ask whether they pay their fair share of taxes, or inquire about their charitable donations.
Such things tell us something about their concern for the public good.
Similarly, the revelation three years ago that the then-Australian opposition leader and aspiring prime minister, Mark Latham, had assaulted a taxi driver and broken his arm in a dispute about a fare was relevant for those who believe that a nation’s leader should be slow to anger.
But does the legitimate interest in knowing more about a politician extend to details about personal relations?
It is hard to draw a line of principle around any area and determine if knowledge of it will provide relevant information about a politician’s moral character.
The problem is that the media have an interest in publishing information that increases their audience, and personal information, especially of a sexual nature, will often do just that.
Even so, whether people choose to marry or not, whether they are heterosexual or homosexual, even whether they pay to fulfill their erotic fantasies or have fantasies they can fulfill at no cost, tells us little about whether they are good people who can be trusted with high office – unless, of course, they say one thing while doing another.
If we can cultivate a wider tolerance of human diversity, politicians, business leaders, and administrators would be less fearful of “exposure,” because they would realize that they have done nothing that they must hide.
Prostitution is illegal in most of the US, including Washington DC, and this could be one reason why Tobias had to resign.
But when New Jersey Governor John Corzine was involved in a serious road accident last month, it became known that he violated his own state’s law by not wearing his seat belt.
By any sensible measure, Corzine’s violation of the law was more serious than that of Tobias.
Laws requiring the wearing of seatbelts save many lives.
Laws prohibiting prostitution do no evident good at all, and may well do harm.
Yet no one suggested that Corzine should resign because of his foolish and illegal act.
In the US, at least, breaching sexual norms still brings with it a moral opprobrium that is unrelated to any real harm it may do.
A Productivity Boom-in-Waiting?
BERKELEY – A double-dip recession is one thing, but a lost decade is something far more sinister.
In the United States, there is growing concern that the worst recession since the Great Depression has damaged the economy’s capacity to grow.
Indeed, there are good reasons for worrying that the US and other advanced countries will now be consigned to a long period of sub-par growth.
Having been burned by the crisis, banks have tightened their lending standards, and will now be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.
As a result, bank credit will be harder to obtain.
A more limited supply of bank credit will mean higher capital costs.
Small and medium-sized firms – the most important sources of innovation and employment growth – will feel the effects most acutely.
Governments, for their part, will come out of the crisis more heavily indebted, which implies higher future taxes, less investment, and hence slower rates of growth.
Another worry is that the crisis will create a hard core of long-term unemployed whose skills atrophy and who become stigmatized in the eyes of potential employers.
Rising structural unemployment will reduce labor input and efficiency.
It is harder to grow when construction workers and hedge-fund managers have to be retrained to work as welders and nurses.
This mismatch between skills supplied and demanded represents a serious drag on employment growth.
All of these effects were evident in the wake of the Great Depression, too.
In the US, there was zero growth in bank lending between 1933, the trough of the Depression, and 1937, the subsequent business-cycle peak.
Investment suffered.
Stocks of both equipment and structures were actually lower in 1941 than in 1929.
Similarly, mismatch problems hindered the transfer of human resources from declining to expanding sectors.
In Britain, where coalminers were unemployed in large numbers, the expansion of the motor-vehicle and engineering industries was hindered by a shortage of skilled mechanics.
Everywhere, long-term unemployment became acute.
Skills were lost, and the hard core of unemployed were stigmatized and demoralized. An influential 1933 study of the Austrian town of Marienthal by the sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld painted this dismal picture in detail.
George Orwell graphically described it in The Road to Wigan Pier.
The result was a disappointing, all-but-jobless recovery.
In the US, unemployment was still 14% in 1937, four full years into the recovery, and in 1940, on the eve of the country’s entry into World War II.
But there was another side to this coin.
Output expanded robustly after 1933.
Between 1933 and 1937, the US economy grew by 8% a year.
Between 1938 and 1941, growth averaged more than 10%.
Rapid output growth without equally rapid capital-stock or employment growth must have reflected rapid productivity growth.
This is the paradox of the 1930’s.
Despite being a period of chronic high unemployment, corporate bankruptcies, and continuing financial difficulties, the 1930’s recorded the fastest productivity growth of any decade in US history.
How could this be?
As the economic historian Alexander Field has shown, many firms took the “down time” created by weak demand for their products to reorganize their operations.
Factories that had previously used a single centralized power source installed more flexible small electric motors on the shop floor.
Railways reorganized their operations to make more efficient use of both rolling stock and workers.
More firms established modern personnel-management departments and in-house research labs.
There are hints of firms responding similarly now.
General Motors, faced with an existential crisis, has sought to transform its business model.
US airlines have used the lull in demand for their services to reorganize both their equipment and personnel, much like the railways in the 1930’s.
Firms in both manufacturing and services are adopting new information technologies – today’s analog to small electric motors – to optimize supply chains and quality-management systems.
So, even if there are good reasons to expect a period of sub-par investment and employment growth, this need not translate into slow productivity or GDP growth.
But this positive productivity response is not guaranteed.
Policymakers must encourage it.
Small, innovative firms need enhanced access to credit.
Firms need stronger tax incentives for R&amp;D. Productivity growth can be boosted by public investment in infrastructure, as illustrated by the 1930’s examples of the Hoover Dam and the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Productivity growth makes many things possible.
It makes it easier to eliminate budget deficits, and it makes it possible to increase education spending and to fund training schemes for the long-term unemployed.
But, even if rapid productivity growth is possible under current circumstances, it cannot be taken for granted.
Policymakers need to act.
A Recovery for All
NEW YORK – Over the last two years, the majority of countries in the world chose to expand public spending in order to buffer the impact of the global financial crisis on their economies and populations.
But, this year, with signs of economic recovery emerging, advanced countries have quickly shifted from fiscal stimulus to fiscal consolidation.
Now developing countries are also following the trend to consolidate.
A recent UNICEF survey of 126 countries shows that a significant number of low- and middle-income countries are expected to reduce public expenditures in 2010-2011.
This comes at a bad time, just after world governments committed themselves to achieving the development goals, such as reducing poverty and infant mortality, agreed last September at the United Nations’ Millennium Summit.
For most low- and middle-income countries, the incipient economic recovery appears to be fragile and uneven.
Indeed, many of these countries remain vulnerable to volatile commodity prices, financial-system weaknesses, depressed demand from world markets, and shortfalls in external finance, overseas development assistance, and investment.
More importantly, according to the UN and the World Bank, the social impact of the global economic crisis continues to be felt in terms of rising hunger, unemployment, and social unrest.
The combination of rising food and fuel prices and the financial and economic crisis has reduced poor families’ purchasing power, access to social services, and employment opportunities.
Moreover, poor households have reduced food consumption, with the UN Food and Agricultural Organization estimating that nearly one billion people are hungry and malnourished.
In addition to the millions already pushed into poverty in 2008-09, another 64 million could fall into extreme poverty during 2010 as a result of the combined, lingering effects of the crisis.
In the 1980’s, adjustment programs required countries to cut back on their expenditures, including outlays on education, health, water, agriculture, and other sectors that make a difference to poor households.
As the late Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere demanded publicly: “Must we starve our children to pay our debts?”
Infant mortality rates rose among low-income groups in many developing countries, and inequality increased.
This period came to be known as the “lost decade.” UNICEF responded with Adjustment with a Human Face, which argued that children must be protected during economic crises.
It argued for more expansionary macroeconomic policies to generate employment, public-sector investments to serve the poor, and the establishment of social-protection systems.
Thirty years later, déjà vu, the same message applies.
The poor in developing countries are again being made to endure the worst consequences of a crisis that they played no part in creating.
It is critically important that this does not lead to a new lost decade of development, and that poor households – especially children – do not suffer as they did in the 1980‘s.
And yet that could very well happen.
Our UNICEF survey of 126 developing countries found that among the nearly one-half that are reducing public expenditures, common adjustment measures include public-sector wage cuts or caps, withdrawal of food subsidies, and the targeting and rationalization of already meager social-protection systems.
These adjustment measures are often adopted without carefully examining their social impact.
How many poor children will suffer – or die – from lack of food and health care?
How many children will miss out on education because teachers are absent due to low wages, or simply because poor children must work to supplement their family income?
Adjustment of public expenditures raises the risk of a recovery that discriminates against the poor, and thus fuels greater inequities in developing countries.
Premature fiscal contraction and/or withdrawal of countercyclical measures threaten the public support that is essential to promoting recovery among those hardest hit by the crisis.
As the global recession ebbs, the most urgent imperative is recovery for all – a recovery that is inclusive, expands employment opportunities, reduces inequalities, and sustains development processes.
This can be achieved.
It requires that aid to poor countries be sustained; that governments focus on expansionary macroeconomic policies that support employment and broad-based economic activities; that new schemes be introduced to extend health services and social protection for the poor; and that investments in education, water supply, sanitation, agriculture, and food security receive the support they need.
A Referendum For Kurdistan?
The assassination of the President of Iraq's Governing Council makes it crystal clear that the US is failing to create the minimal law-and-order needed for any sort of orderly transfer of power to take place by June 30th.
Barely two months ago, the signing of a constitutional document by a US-appointed group of un-elected Iraqi officials was heralded as if it were the re-enactment of America's constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787.
But by now it is clear that this is a worthless piece of paper.
No imposed constitution, however elegant it may be, will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, however, the situation is completely different: in the last ten years, under the protection of the Allies' no-fly zone, and even more so since the toppling of Saddam, the Kurdish regional government has been able to establish and sustain a relatively orderly administration.
It has overcome tribal and party differences and created ade facto functioning government, with an impressive record on development issues such as education, irrigation, and construction - and, above all, with no violence.
Confronted with the debacle in the rest of (Arab) Iraq, the question has to be asked why the US-led coalition should not hold a referendum in the Kurdish region, asking the population how they would like to be ruled.
After all, the Kurds have, by any internationally accepted standards, a right to self-determination.
Historically, the Kurds - who are distinct in language, culture, and historical consciousness from Arabs - never had their day in court.
After World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Allies promised them a state of their own - a promise that was cynically betrayed when British and French imperial interests took precedence.
Since then, the Kurds have suffered under the despotic rule of rival ethnic groups.
There are obvious obstacles to holding such a referendum, primarily because the US does not have a mandate to dispose of Iraq as it pleases.
But the same goes for the rest of Iraq: the US is now lamely asking for a UN resolution mandating a transfer of power to a legitimate Iraqi government - but such an authorization is highly unlikely, nor is there anyone in Iraq to whom authority can conceivably be transferred.
Why should the one region - and people - who run an orderly government, are not involved in murder, attacks on mosques, and suicide bombing of schoolchildren, be penalized?
Another objection is the opposition of Turkey - and, to a lesser degree, Iran and Syria - to granting the Iraqi Kurds self-determination.
But if one thinks in terms of universal norms of human rights, what right has Turkey to dictate internal development in another country?
After all, nobody accepts Israel's claim to oppose as a matter of principle the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
The same should apply to Turkey.
If Turkey grants its own Kurdish minority more cultural and language rights and allows legitimate Kurdish political representation in the Turkish parliament, the willingness of Turkish Kurds to oppose Ankara will be diminished.
In the nineteenth century, the joint interests of the authoritarian Russian, German, and Austrian Empires prevented the establishment of a free Poland: such unholy alliances have no place in the twenty-first century.
Recently, under the aegis of the UN, a referendum on the future of Cyprus was held within the island's Greek and Turkish communities.
The outcome was paradoxical, and not to the liking of those who initiated it: but the right of the communities to determine their future was accepted.
Why not in Iraqi Kurdistan?
Perhaps to assuage political fears - and considerations of international law - any plebiscite in the Kurdish region should, initially, have only a consultative status.
But it will give legitimate expression to the will of a people long oppressed and entitled to their place in the sun.
Such a referendum may also concentrate minds among the Arab Sunnis and Shia in Iraq, when they come to realize that it is their violence that is dismantling Iraq.
Perhaps they may decide that violence is counter-productive and carries its own penalties, and may then follow the Kurdish example of curbing violence, which would help put Iraq together again without recourse to permanent repression.
If not, at the very least, the injustice suffered by the Kurdish people for generations would, at long last, be rectified.
A Referendum on Obama
STANFORD – Successful political candidates try to implement the proposals on which they ran.
In the United States, President Barack Obama and the Democrats, controlling the House of Representatives and (a filibuster-proof) Senate, had the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 – and so they did.
Obama and his congressional allies enacted an $800 billion “stimulus” bill that was loaded with programs geared to key Democratic constituencies, such as environmentalists and public employees; adopted a sweeping and highly unpopular health-care reform (whose constitutionality will be determined by the Supreme Court this year); imposed vast new regulations on wide swaths of the economy; embraced an industrial policy that selects certain companies for special treatment; engaged in borrowing and spending at levels exceeded only in World War II; and centralized power in Washington, DC (and, within the federal government, in the executive branch and regulatory agencies).
The last election that was followed by such a sweeping change in policy direction occurred in 1980, when President Ronald Reagan overhauled taxes, spending, and regulation, and supported the Federal Reserve’s course of disinflation.
While the 1988, 1992, and 2000 elections were also quite consequential, the policy shifts were not nearly as large as in 1980 and 2008.
The country rebelled against Obama and the Democrats’ lurch to the left with historic Congressional election victories for Republicans in 2010.
Since then, many Republicans have been deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives has been unable to roll back much of Obama’s agenda.
But the US political system is set up to make it much harder to accomplish something than to block it.
It is not easy to do a lot while controlling only one-half of one-third of the federal government.
The 2012 election is shaping up as a referendum on Obama’s policies and performance.
The economy is improving slowly, but it remains in bad shape, with high unemployment and millions having left the labor force.
Republicans are expected to retain control of the House and regain a majority in the Senate.
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican frontrunner to challenge Obama in November, and the party’s other leading candidates, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, want less spending, major reforms of government programs, lower taxes, trade expansion, and less and more-targeted regulation than does Obama.
Romney, for example, has a detailed 59-point economic program, including a cap on federal spending at 20% of GDP, which would require reductions similar to those in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
Gingrich and the other Republicans have an even more aggressive agenda of cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of government.
The eventual nominee would be wise to incorporate his opponents’ best ideas and top people into his campaign.
A Republican presidential victory, together with Republican control of the House and Senate, would likely lead to substantial reduction, repeal, and replacement of many Obama initiatives, attempts to reform taxes and entitlements, and measures to impose greater fiscal discipline.
High on Romney’s agenda is a reduction of the corporate-tax rate, from 35% to 25%, the OECD average level (the other Republican candidates would lower it still more), which would redress a major competitive disadvantage for American multinational companies’ global business.
A Republican victory would also most likely lead to a major push to open up many more energy-exploration opportunities within America, which Obama has stymied.
Romney has promised tougher negotiations on trade and currency with China, but is generally far more likely to push new trade agreements than the labor-supported Obama administration.
If, however, Democrats retain control of the Senate, this will be far more difficult to accomplish.
A Republican president also would make appointments to many key policymaking positions, from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to regulatory agencies.
If Obama is re-elected, and Republicans control the House and Senate, his legislative agenda will essentially be a dead letter, and he will spend the next two years, at least, negotiating its reform and rollback.
In this scenario, the policy center of gravity in the Republican party would shift to House Speaker John Boehner, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and other key Representatives, including David Camp, Kevin Brady, and Kevin McCarthy, along with several Senators.
In that case, Obama would be wise to move to the center (as Bill Clinton did after the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994) and work with congressional Republicans to shape sensible tax and entitlement reforms.
But that seems unlikely: since the Democrats’ massive defeat in 2010, Obama has moved even further to the left, embracing a more populist agenda.
Regardless of the outcome of this year’s presidential and congressional elections, various Republican state governors are likely to gain a higher national profile.
All of them –&nbsp;including Mitch Daniels of Indiana, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bob McDonnell of Virginia, and former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida – declined to seek the Republican presidential nomination, but will be on the short list for 2016 should Obama win in November.
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously described the states as “laboratories”: they should be allowed to experiment and learn from each other which policies work.
For example, Clinton and the Republican Congress based landmark 1996 welfare reform on policies originated by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and successfully emulated by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, both reformist Republicans.
The current cohort of Republican governors offers similarly innovative state-level solutions – for example, on spending, debt, and unfunded pension and health liabilities – as models for the country.
Until November, divided government and contentious campaigning will most likely prevent significant policy moves.
But, following the election, taxes and spending, trade policy, federalism, regulation, and defense will take a different course – how different depends on who wins – with important implications for America’s fiscal position, external balance, and much else, including its relations with the rest of the world.
America’s Hope Against Hope
NEW YORK – After a hard-fought election campaign, costing well in excess of $2 billion, it seems to many observers that not much has changed in American politics: Barack Obama is still President, the Republicans still control the House of Representatives, and the Democrats still have a majority in the Senate.
With America facing a “fiscal cliff” – automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the start of 2013 that will most likely drive the economy into recession unless bipartisan agreement on an alternative fiscal path is reached – could there be anything worse than continued political gridlock?
In fact, the election had several salutary effects – beyond showing that unbridled corporate spending could not buy an election, and that demographic changes in the United States may doom Republican extremism.
The Republicans’ explicit campaign of disenfranchisement in some states – like Pennsylvania, where they tried to make it more difficult for African-Americans and Latinos to register to vote – backfired: those whose rights were threatened were motivated to turn out and exercise them.
In Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor and tireless warrior for reforms to protect ordinary citizens from banks’ abusive practices, won a seat in the Senate.
Some of Mitt Romney’s advisers seemed taken aback by Obama’s victory: Wasn’t the election supposed to be about economics?
They were confident that Americans would forget how the Republicans’ deregulatory zeal had brought the economy to the brink of ruin, and that voters had not noticed how their intransigence in Congress had prevented more effective policies from being pursued in the wake of the 2008 crisis.
Voters, they assumed, would focus only on the current economic malaise.
The Republicans should not have been caught off-guard by Americans’ interest in issues like disenfranchisement and gender equality. While these issues strike at the core of a country’s values – of what we mean by democracy and limits on government intrusion into individuals’ lives – they are also economic issues.
As I explain in my book The Price of Inequality, much of the rise in US economic inequality is attributable to a government in which the rich have disproportionate influence –&amp; and use that influence to entrench themselves.
Obviously, issues like reproductive rights and gay marriage have large economic consequences as well.
In terms of economic policy for the next four years, the main cause for post-election celebration is that the US has avoided measures that would have pushed it closer to recession, increased inequality, imposed further hardship on the elderly, and impeded access to health care for millions of Americans.
Beyond that, here is what Americans should hope for: a strong “jobs” bill – based on investments in education, health care, technology, and infrastructure – that would stimulate the economy, restore growth, reduce unemployment, and generate tax revenues far in excess of its costs, thus improving the country’s fiscal position.
They might also hope for a housing program that finally addresses America’s foreclosure crisis.
A comprehensive program to increase economic opportunity and reduce inequality is also needed – its goal being to remove, within the next decade, America’s distinction as the advanced country with the highest inequality and the least social mobility.
This implies, among other things, a fair tax system that is more progressive and eliminates the distortions and loopholes that allow speculators to pay taxes at a lower effective rate than those who work for a living, and that enable the rich to use the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their fair share.
America – and the world – would also benefit from a US energy policy that reduces reliance on imports not just by increasing domestic production, but also by cutting consumption, and that recognizes the risks posed by global warming.
Moreover, America’s science and technology policy must reflect an understanding that long-term increases in living standards depend upon productivity growth, which reflects technological progress that assumes a solid foundation of basic research.
Finally, the US needs a financial system that serves all of society, rather than operating as if it were an end in itself.
That means that the system’s focus must shift from speculative and proprietary trading to lending and job creation, which implies reforms of financial-sector regulation, and of anti-trust and corporate-governance laws, together with adequate enforcement to ensure that markets do not become rigged casinos.
Globalization has made all countries more interdependent, in turn requiring greater global cooperation.
We might hopethat America will show more leadership in reforming the global financial system by advocating for stronger international regulation, a global reserve system, and better ways to restructure sovereign debt; in addressing global warming; in democratizing the international economic institutions; and in providing assistance to poorer countries.

Americans should hope for all of this, though I am not sanguine that they will get much of it.&amp; More likely, America will muddle through – here another little program for struggling students and homeowners, there the end of the Bush tax cuts for millionaires, but no wholesale tax reform, serious cutbacks in defense spending, or significant progress on global warming.
With the euro crisis likely to continue unabated, America’s continuing malaise does not bode well for global growth.
Even worse, in the absence of strong American leadership, longstanding global problems – from climate change to urgently needed reforms of the international monetary system – will continue to fester.
Nonetheless, we should be grateful: it is better to be standing still than it is to be heading in the wrong direction.
A Relationship Strengthened by Crisis
NEW YORK – In recent years, emerging-market countries, including those in Asia, have made impressive strides in strengthening their fundamentals, accelerating their economic growth and cushioning themselves against external shocks.
Nevertheless, as the events of recent months have shown, emerging markets are not immune from the current bout of global financial turmoil.
In particular, slowing global economic demand poses daunting challenges for many Asian economies, especially those that are more dependent on export-led growth.
While most Asian countries have had relatively limited direct exposure to mortgage-related assets, deleveraging by foreign investors and slowing external demand have simultaneously created tighter credit conditions and lower expectations for growth.
This has led to heightened volatility in equity, money, and debt markets.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });These developments put to rest the notion of “decoupling,” the idea that economic growth in emerging markets, whether in Asia or elsewhere, is independent from that of the developed world.
As the current crisis makes painfully clear, in this era of global trade and investment, our economies − and our prosperity − are inextricably linked.
In order to maintain strong economic growth in America, we need a strong, growing Asia, just as Asia’s success depends on a thriving US.
The US-Asia economic partnership can be strengthened if we heed the lessons that we have already learned from the ongoing turmoil.
Undoubtedly, much of the current situation will be best understood with the benefit of time, but five lessons are already coming into focus, and we should consider their implications for the choices policymakers will make in the future.  
First, openness to international trade and investment has been and will continue to be the linchpin of economic growth for the global economy.
The US and Asia are more mutually dependent than ever for their economic growth and prosperity.
In the current climate of anxiety and uncertainty, policymakers must ensure strong communication and coordination, avoid beggar-thy-neighbor policies, and guard against protectionism.
Fortunately, as the crisis has worsened, global policymakers have responded with coordinated policy action.
The G-7 action plan aims to restore the flow of credit by securing interbank lending, and coordinated central bank actions have provided unprecedented levels of liquidity to the market.
Bilaterally, the Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED), which has been an invaluable forum for building US-China economic relations, has been especially important in strengthening our lines of communication and cooperation during the crisis.
And many policymakers around the world have reaffirmed their commitment to completing a successful Doha trade round and refraining from raising new barriers to trade and investment.
Second, it is also clear that developed countries must act rapidly and in concert to minimize the impact of the crisis on emerging markets.
As is always the case, however, resources alone cannot solve problems rooted in weak policies.
Before we provide financial assistance, whether bilaterally or through the international financial institutions (IFIs), we must determine the underlying cause of economic vulnerability and ensure necessary corrective action.
Lending large sums before assessing root causes and determining appropriate policy responses can undermine the IFIs’ credibility and reduce the capital available to assist other countries in need.
When resources are needed, however, the IFIs are a logical place to turn, and they must show flexibility and adaptability to help their member countries.
Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have taken encouraging steps to develop new programs and approaches and quickly increase their commitments.
The IMF recently established the Short-Term Liquidity Facility to help strong-performing members facing temporary liquidity problems.
The World Bank and the multilateral development banks are also developing innovative ways to strengthen country financial sectors and address potential shortfalls in trade finance.
Third, as the IFIs play an even more crucial role, further delay in reforming them to include major emerging-market economies will only harm their effectiveness and legitimacy.
But greater representation is not a one-way street: with greater voice and influence, emerging-market countries must assume greater leadership responsibilities and act as constructive partners in these institutions.
Fourth, governments and the IFIs cannot solve this crisis alone, and they cannot and should not crowd out the private sector.
In situations where government intervention is necessary, we must consider specific ways in which the private sector can assist in the recovery.
For example, the US has helped promote financial-sector stability with direct capital injections, but ultimately it is the banks that must resume responsible lending to consumers and businesses. Moreover, the US Treasury has structured its Capital Purchase Program with disincentives for long-term government ownership.
Finally, both Asia and the US must remain focused on addressing the fundamental macroeconomic policy challenges that contributed to the crisis.
Some of these challenges, such as the buildup of global imbalances, have been discussed for many years.
The turmoil has led to a gradual rebalancing, with the US current-account deficit beginning to narrow and emerging markets taking steps to boost domestic demand.
But we must guard against the re-emergence of significant imbalances, which means, in part, assuring the exchange-rate flexibility that must play a critical role in allowing needed economic adjustments to occur.
Many of the important steps taken to stabilize the global financial system and economy, as well as to address the root causes of this crisis, will be achieved through the G-20.
It is also clear that the US and Asia will be at the center of any effective multilateral action.
We must therefore seek to enhance our cooperation and leverage our regional, multilateral, and bilateral dialogues and relationships to ensure the integrity and efficacy of these efforts.
The road ahead will not be easy, but the US-Asia economic partnership will be at the heart of our recovery.
And our economic relationship will no doubt emerge even stronger as a consequence of weathering this storm together.
A Reset in the Caucasus
YEREVAN – Will Turkey’s current turmoil between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the country’s powerful army complicate and delay the country’s boldest initiatives in years – the moves to address decades-old tensions with both Armenians and Kurds?
Restructuring the role of Turkey’s army is vital, but if Turkey cannot follow through with the Armenian and Kurdish openings, the country’s own domestic situation, its relations with the two peoples, as well as tensions in the Caucasus, will undoubtedly worsen.
Of the several flashpoints in the region, including that between Georgia and Russia over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the tension between Armenians and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh is among the most challenging.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });As to Georgia and Russia, the disproportionate size, weight, and power on one side are enough to deter any return to violence.
Moreover, there are no entangling alliances complicating the matter.
Georgia is not a NATO member, and the United States, it is clear, will not go to war with Russia over Georgia.
The Armenian-Azerbaijani struggle is more precarious.
It is no longer a two-way tug-of-war between two small post-Soviet republics, but part of an Armenia-Turkey-Azerbaijan triangle. This triangle is the direct consequence of the process of normalization between Armenia and Turkey, which began when both countries’ presidents met at a football game.
That process now hinges on protocols for establishing diplomatic relations that have been signed by both governments but unratified by either parliament.
Completing the process depends directly and indirectly on how Armenians and Azerbaijan work to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
This snarled three-way dispute, if not carefully untangled, holds many dangers.
Turkey, which for nearly two decades has proclaimed its support for Azerbaijan, publicly conditioned rapprochement with Armenia on Armenian concessions to Azerbaijan.
Turkey, a NATO member, is thus a party to this conflict now, and any military flare-up between Armenians and Azerbaijanis might draw it in – possibly triggering Russia’s involvement, either through its bilateral commitments to Armenia, or through the Collective Security Treaty Organization, of which Armenia and Russia are members.
Given energy-security concerns, any Azerbaijani conflict would also seriously affect Europe.
Iran, too would be affected, since it is a frontline state with interests in the region.
Armenians and Azerbaijanis have not clashed militarily for more than a decade and a half. But this is only because there has been the perception of a military balance and a hope that ongoing negotiations would succeed.
Today, both factors have changed.
The perception of military parity has altered.
With Azerbaijan having spent extravagantly on armaments in recent years it may now have convinced itself that it now holds the upper hand.
At the same time, there is less hope in negotiations, which appear to be stalled, largely because they have been linked to the Armenia-Turkey process, which also seems to be in limbo.
The diplomatic protocols awaiting ratification by the two countries’ parliaments have fallen victim to miscalculations on both sides.
The Armenians came to believe that Turkey would find a way to reconcile Azerbaijan’s interests with the Turkish opening to Armenia, and would open the border with Armenia regardless of progress on resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
The problem is that Turkey initially closed the border precisely because of Nagorno-Karabakh, rather than any bilateral issue.
Turkey believed that by signing protocols with Armenia and clearly indicating its readiness to open the border, the Armenians could somehow be cajoled or pressured into resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh problem more quickly or cede territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
But this has always been unlikely in the absence of a comprehensive settlement that addresses Armenians’ greatest fear – security – and fulfils their basic political requirement, namely a definition of Nagorno-Karabakh’s status.
Both sides seem to be somewhat surprised by the other’s expectations.
Indeed, there is a growing fear that a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute is more distant now, because Turkey’s public backing has raised Azerbaijan’s expectations, while some Armenians fear collusion between neighbors out to railroad them into an unsustainable agreement.
This is Turkey’s moment of truth.
The Armenia-Turkey diplomatic process has stalled, and the Turkish government’s effort at reconciliation with the country’s large Kurdish minority has soured.
Just as a loss of confidence among Kurds and Turks in eastern Turkey will rock the shaky stability that they have recently enjoyed, a loss of hope for a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute may end the tentative military calm between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
But the situation is not irretrievable.
Endless public sparring between Turkish and Armenian officials through the media is not helping.
It is time for both countries’ leaders to speak privately and directly with each other, with an understanding of the instability that could result from any failure to complete the diplomatic opening that the two sides initiated.
So, even as Turkey tries to deal with the consequences of its history at home, and redefine the army’s role in society, it must reset its tortured relationship with Armenia.
The recent resolution passed by the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Congress, which calledupon President Obama to ensure that US foreign policy reflects an “appropriate understanding and sensitivity” concerning the Armenian Genocide, should serve as a wake-up call to both Turkish and Armenian governments that Armenians are not about to question the historical veracity of the genocide.After all, if France and Germany can face their tortured history, Turkey should be able to do so as well.
The two sides must step back, look at the situation dispassionately, acknowledge thedeficiencies in the protocols, address the other side’s minimum requirements, and bear in mind that a single document will not heal all wounds or wipe out all fears. 
The international community must support this effort.
The problem should not be dismissed as a mere settling of old scores.
What is at stake is the future of a region critical to Eurasia’s peace.
A Rio Report Card
NEW YORK – One of the world’s pre-eminent scientific publications, Nature, has just issued a scathing report card in advance of next week’s Rio+20 summit on sustainable development.
The grades for implementation of the three great treaties signed at the first Rio Earth Summit in 1992 were as follows: Climate Change – F; Biological Diversity – F; and Combating Desertification – F. Can humanity still avoid getting itself expelled?
We have known for at least a generation that the world needs a course correction.
Instead of powering the world economy with fossil fuels, we need to mobilize much greater use of low-carbon alternatives such as wind, solar, and geothermal power.
Instead of hunting, fishing, and clearing land without regard for the impact on other species, we need to pace our agricultural production, fishing, and logging in line with the environment’s carrying capacity.
Instead of leaving the world’s most vulnerable people without access to family planning, education, and basic health care, we need to end extreme poverty and reduce the soaring fertility rates that persist in the poorest parts of the world.
In short, we need to recognize that with seven billion people today, and nine billion by mid-century, all inter-connected in a high-tech, energy-intensive global economy, our collective capacity to destroy the planet’s life-support systems is unprecedented.
Yet the consequences of our individual actions are typically so far removed from our daily awareness that we can go right over the cliff without even knowing it.
When we power our computers and lights, we are unaware of the carbon emissions that result.
When we eat our meals, we are unaware of the deforestation that has resulted from unsustainable farming.
And when billions of our actions combine to create famines and floods halfway around the world, afflicting the poorest people in drought-prone Mali and Kenya, few of us are even dimly aware of the dangerous snares of global interconnectedness.
Twenty years ago, the world tried to address these realities through treaties and international law.
The agreements that emerged in 1992 at the first Rio summit were good ones: thoughtful, far-sighted, public-spirited, and focused on global priorities.
Yet they have not saved us.
Those treaties lived in the shadow of our daily politics, imaginations, and media cycles.&nbsp; Diplomats trudged off to conferences year after year to implement them, but the main results were neglect, delay, and bickering over legalities.
Twenty years on, we have only three failing grades to show for our efforts.
Is there a different way?
The path through international law engages lawyers and diplomats, but not the engineers, scientists, and community leaders on the front lines of sustainable development.
It is littered with technical arcana about monitoring, binding obligations, annex-I and non-annex-I countries, and thousands of other legalisms, but has failed to give humanity the language to discuss our own survival.
We have thousands of documents but a failure to speak plainly to one other.
Do we want to save ourselves and our children?
Why didn’t we say so?
At Rio+20 we will have to say so, clearly, decisively, and in a way that leads to problem-solving and action, not to bickering and defensiveness.
Since politicians follow public opinion rather than lead it, it must be the public itself that demands its own survival, not elected officials who are somehow supposed to save us despite ourselves.
There are few heroes in politics; waiting for the politicians would be to wait too long.
The most important outcome in Rio, therefore, will not be a new treaty, binding clause, or political commitment.
It will be a global call to action.
Around the world, the cry is rising to put sustainable development at the center of global thinking and action, especially to help young people to solve the triple-bottom-line challenge – economic well-being, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion – that will define their era.&nbsp;Rio+20 can help them to do it.
Rather than a new treaty, let us adopt at Rio+20 a set of Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, that will inspire a generation to act.
Just as the Millennium Development Goals opened our eyes to extreme poverty and promoted unprecedented global action to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, the SDGs can open the eyes of today’s youth to climate change, biodiversity loss, and the disasters of desertification.
We can still make good on the three Rio treaties, by putting people at the forefront of the effort.

SDGs to end extreme poverty; decarbonize the energy system; slow population growth; promote sustainable food supplies; protect the oceans, forests, and drylands; and redress the inequalities of our time can galvanize a generation’s worth of problem-solving.&nbsp; Engineers and technology wizards from Silicon Valley to São Paolo to Bangalore to Shanghai have world-saving ideas up their sleeves.
Universities around the world are home to legions of students and faculty intent on solving practical problems in their communities and countries.
Businesses, at least the good ones, know that they can’t flourish and motivate their workers and consumers unless they are part of the solution.
The world is poised to act.
Rio+20 can help to unleash a generation of action.
There is still time, just barely, to turn the F’s to A’s, and to pass humanity’s ultimate test.
A Roadmap to Peace that Can Work
In the days after the so-called "Roadmap for Peace between Israel and Palestine" was unveiled, a new cycle of violence exploded between the warring parties.
Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli attacks against Palestinian leaders came with such speed and ferocity that determining who was striking first and who was counterattacking became impossible.
Of course, recriminations also began immediately, with Israelis and Palestinians each accusing the other of deliberately destroying the peace process.
The truth, as usual, is more complicated, and understanding it helps us to comprehend what will be needed if real peace is to be achieved.
There are at least four sides to this conflict: moderate and extremist Israelis and moderate and extremist Palestinians.
Complicated strategic interactions exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within the two sides.
The extremist positions are clear.
Extremist Palestinians vow to fight until Israel--viewed as a colonial imposition on the Islamic world--is destroyed.
Extremist Israelis vow to fight to hold the entire West Bank, pushing out the Palestinians if necessary.
For them, Israel's pre-1967 borders, the entire city of Jerusalem, and the West Bank of the Jordan River is land given to the Jewish people by God.
No land-for-peace deal will satisfy either side.
Large majorities on both sides--perhaps two-thirds or even three-fourths of each population--would accept a return by Israel to something like its pre-1967 borders in exchange for real peace.
Of course, moderates on both sides would prefer as much land and room to maneuver as possible, but they prefer a negotiated compromise aimed at ending the violence.
The moderates are understandably wary.
Compromise on their side if met by extremism on the other would incite disaster.
If Israel returns to its pre-1967 borders, only to find continuing hostility and terrorism among the Palestinians, Israel will have gravely weakened its security for nothing.
If Palestinians disarm but still confront Israeli demands to keep West Bank settlements, then Palestine will never have a viable state.
Compromise is therefore difficult even among moderates: it requires a belief that moderation on one side will be met by moderation on the other.
The Oslo Peace Process was built on the premise that moderates on both sides would gradually gain each other's trust and move steadily towards compromise.
But this largely ignored the role of extremists.
Israeli extremists assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, lest he mobilize broad public support to make peace.
Arab extremists launched attacks against Israelis civilians, in part to show moderates on both sides that compromise would not stick.
That dynamic is still at work.
Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen has called on Palestinian extremists to disarm, or at least to accept a prolonged cease-fire, but they have responded with more terrorist attacks.
Israel's government, meanwhile, has gone out of its way to attack Palestinian hard-line groups, causing more death, damage, and bitter feelings.
Extremists on both sides "win" their battle to undermine the peace process.
But all factions lose, because violence continues and none of them achieves its goals.
Israelis and Palestinians cannot find the way out alone, because neither side would dare to forcibly disarm its own extremists without absolute proof that the other side will do the same.
So it is fatuous for Israel's government to insist that the Palestinians disarm completely before the peace process can continue, when Palestinian moderates have no proof that Israel will withdraw to the pre-1967 boundaries.
In these circumstances, gradual confidence building will not work.
Extremists simply have enough power to undermine a process based on trust alone.
Nor will one side's extremists defeat the other side's extremists.
Israel's military has failed to destroy Palestinian terrorism through hard-line reprisals; Palestinian extremists have not scared Israeli hard-liners into concessions.
A solution is possible only if the outside world is prepared to police an agreement reached between the moderate majorities.
A strong international peacekeeping force, agreed by the UN, and perhaps led by the US or NATO, must be placed between the warring sides, and must be prepared to suffer losses to terrorists in the service of peace.
The roadmap is--so far--silent on this issue.
When UN Secretary General Kofi Annan made such a proposal, extremists on both sides denounced the plan. But moderates raised red flags, too.
Would a peacekeeping force truly serve the interests of the agreement, rather than one side or the other?
Would it have the firepower to hold back extremists?
Would it stick to its long-term mission in the face of inevitable attacks?
Would peacekeepers withdraw at one side's insistence (as UN peacekeepers have retreated in other circumstances, including just before the 1967 Six Day War), putting the other side in jeopardy?
The Roadmap to Peace can work only if both sides are pressed to a real compromise, whose outline is clear: Israel's return to something like its pre-1967 borders; financial compensation of Palestinians for losses of land in Israel, rather than a right to return; and Jerusalem as a shared capital.
But enforcement of this compromise against extremists will require putting credible and well-armed international peacekeepers in place to hold the parties to the deal.
Designing such an international peacekeeping effort, one with the credibility and staying power, should now be a priority.
A Roosevelt Moment for America’s Megabanks?
WASHINGTON, DC – Just over a hundred years ago, the United States led the world in terms of rethinking how big business worked – and when the power of such firms should be constrained.
In retrospect, the breakthrough legislation – not just for the US, but also internationally – was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.
The Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill, which is about to pass the US Senate, does something similar – and long overdue – for banking.
Prior to 1890, big business was widely regarded as more efficient and generally more modern than small business.
Most people saw the consolidation of smaller firms into fewer, large firms as a stabilizing development that rewarded success and allowed for further productive investment.
The creation of America as a major economic power, after all, was made possible by giant steel mills, integrated railway systems, and the mobilization of enormous energy reserves through such ventures as Standard Oil.
But ever-bigger business also had a profound social impact, and here the ledger entries were not all in the positive column.
The people who ran big business were often unscrupulous, and in some cases used their dominant market position to drive out their competitors – enabling the surviving firms subsequently to restrict supply and raise prices.
There was dominance, to be sure, in the local and regional markets of mid-nineteenth-century America, but nothing like what developed in the 50 years that followed.
Big business brought major productivity improvements, but it also increased the power of private companies to act in ways that were injurious to the broader marketplace – and to society.
The Sherman Act itself did not change this situation overnight, but, once President Theodore Roosevelt decided to take up the cause, it became a powerful tool that could be used to break up industrial and transportation monopolies.
By doing so, Roosevelt and those who followed in his footsteps shifted the consensus.
Roosevelt’s first case, against Northern Securities in 1902, was immensely controversial.
But the break-up, a decade later, of Standard Oil – perhaps the most powerful company in the history of the world to that date – was seen by mainstream opinion as completely reasonable.
And the break-up of Standard Oil took place in great American style: the company was split into more than 30 pieces, the shareholders did very well, and the Rockefeller family went on to rehabilitate itself in the eyes of the American public.
Why are these antitrust tools not used against today’s megabanks, which have become so powerful that they can sway legislation and regulation massively in their favor, while also receiving generous taxpayer-financed bailouts as needed?
The answer is that the kind of power that big banks wield today is very different from what was imagined by the Sherman Act’s drafters – or by the people who shaped its application in the early years of the twentieth century.
The banks do not have monopoly pricing power in the traditional sense, and their market share – at the national level – is lower than what would trigger an antitrust investigation in the non-financial sectors.
Effective size caps on banks were imposed by the banking reforms of the 1930’s, and there was an effort to maintain such restrictions in the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994.
But all of these limitations fell by the wayside during the wholesale deregulation of the past 15 years.
Now, however, a new form of antitrust arrives – in the form of the Kanjorski Amendment, whose language was embedded in the Dodd-Frank bill.
Once the bill becomes law, federal regulators will have the right and the responsibility to limit the scope of big banks and, as necessary, break them up when they pose a “grave risk” to financial stability.
This is not a theoretical possibility – such risks manifested themselves quite clearly in late 2008 and into early 2009.
It remains uncertain, of course, whether the regulators would actually take such steps.
But, as Representative Paul Kanjorski, the main force behind the provision, recently put it, “The key lesson of the last decade is that financial regulators must use their powers, rather than coddle industry interests.”
And Kanjorski probably is right that not much would be required. “If just one regulator uses these extraordinary powers [to break up too-big-to-fail banks] just once,” he says, “it will send a powerful message,” one that would “significantly reform how all financial services firms behave forever more.”
Regulators can do a great deal, but they need political direction from the highest level in order to make genuine progress.
Teddy Roosevelt, of course, preferred to “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”
The Kanjorski Amendment is a very big stick.
Who will pick it up?
A Saudi Survival Strategy
Did the bombings that rocked Riyadh shock the al-Saud royal family from its complacency at long last?
This rude interruption to their majesties' indolence by their subjects incited rage and fury and something else--fear.
Of course, alarm bells have rung before in Saudi Arabia, but the ruling family remained in denial--deniability and repression being the political arts at which the al-Saud excel.
If the regime is to forge a survival strategy, it must now re-examine its foundations.
As ruling families go, the al-Saud are spectacularly numerous--there are perhaps as many 22,000 of them.
But vast bloodlines have not prevented hardening of the arteries.
Indeed, the men now struggling to hold things together are the incapacitated King Fahd (84 years old), his half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah (79 years old), and his full brothers, Defence Minister Sultan (78 years old), and Interior Minister Naif (75 years old).
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Old men, unsurprisingly, find it hard to cope with the breakdown of the assumptions that have governed their entire lives.
Perhaps the most shattering lost illusion is the fact that the bombings occurred in the heart of the al-Saud's home-base in the Najdi region, which indicates that the enemy within resides nearer to the throne than anyone suspected.
This recognition is particularly unsettling because the al-Saud have alienated every group except their own.
If some Najdi may now be mistrusted, where can the al-Saud turn?
Saudi Arabia's population is divided into distinctive regional, tribal, and sectarian groups.
To the east, in the oil-rich province, are the Shia.
Politically emboldened since the fall of Saddam's regime and the resurgence of their brethren in Iraq, the Shia wasted no time in petitioning Crown Prince Abdullah to end both their exclusion from Saudi politics and their demonization as heretics by the Wahhabi religious establishment.
Their message to the rulers is that it will no longer suffice to identify being Saudi exclusively with being Wahhabi Najdi.
Meanwhile, the Hijazis, who originate in Mecca and Medina, hold long-repressed resentments due to their humiliating partial inclusion in Saudi politics.
Although the Hijazis, who are Sunnis but not Wahhabis, are not viewed as heretics, they are marginalized because the Islam they practice has Sufi leanings--and tolerant Sufiism is anathema to the austerely dogmatic Wahhabis.
Educated Hijazis ask only for modest reforms.
Yet even moderation is dismissed by the al-Saud.
The tribes of the Asir region, which have a mixed sense of identity due to their close ties to Yemeni tribes, feel alienated from both the political and the economic center.
The population of al-Jawf in the north has a similar sense of political and economic alienation.
Despite long simmering feelings of resentment and dispossession, these `minorities' remain moderate in their demands for reform.
Their leaders want to rescue the state, not raze it.
They form the vast majority of people in Saudi Arabia, and have not yet embraced the uncompromising rage of Osama bin Laden's clones.
The challenge facing the al-Saud is to include at the heart of the political system the peoples they have shunned for decades.
Unless they begin to do so, these peoples will drift into the camp of the fanatics--if not as active terrorists than as passive supporters, much as the Catholic community in Northern Ireland passively embraced IRA terrorism as a way to end their exclusion from political life in the province.
The danger in Saudi Arabia is that the IRA are no match for Muslim fundamentalists in their fanaticism.
For the regime to embrace peoples it has excluded, it must agree on inclusiveness--and the tolerance of non-Wahhabi forms of Islam--as a survival strategy and stick to it.
This is difficult because the ruling al-Saud are themselves divided.
Crown Prince Abdullah is far more disposed to reform than Prince Naif, the powerful Interior Minister, who clings to the old narrow system of repression.
The al-Saud will undoubtedly be ruthless in seeking out the individuals directly implicated in the terrorist bombings.
Those captured face beheading in the traditional way.
The problem for the regime is that the springs that nourish fanaticism will not be dammed by such exemplary punishment.
Some royals recognize this and know that a more thorough housecleaning is needed.
They realize that the al-Saud must choose: continue on the narrow path of repression and ethnic and religious intolerance, or adopt a more open and inclusive policy.
Both choices are fraught with danger: open up, and they include people in Saudi public life hitherto considered unworthy for being either heretics (the Shia) or of impure blood (the Hejazis) or too primitive (the border tribes).
Remain closed, and they will find themselves hostage to the forces of intolerance that threaten the regime.
The al-Saud religious alliance with the Wahhabis and the latter's control of a rigid religious educational system must change.
"Moderate" elements among the population will support this change (and the manhunt for terrorist fanatics) if they secure inclusion in Saudi life.
Alexis de Tocqueville warned that the most dangerous time for any authoritarian regime is when it reforms.
The al-Saud have procrastinated so long that every choice they now face is risky.
Inclusion is the less dangerous path.
It puts at risk only the ethnically narrow and religiously intolerant structure of the regime.
By contrast, the regime itself will be imperiled if it clings to its narrow base.
A Scramble for Asia?
NEW DELHI – Asia’s festering Cold War-era territorial and maritime disputes highlight the fact that securing long-term region-wide peace depends on respect for existing borders.
Attempts to disturb Asia’s territorial status quo are an invitation to endemic conflict – a concern that led Asian states to welcome the US and Russia to their annual East Asian Summit.
The recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic spat over disputed islands in the East China Sea – followed, almost instantly, by a Sino-Vietnamese row over similar atolls – has put the spotlight on China and its regional policy.
Governments across Asia are concerned that China’s rapidly accumulating power is emboldening it to assert territorial and maritime claims against neighbors stretching from Japan to India.
Even against tiny Bhutan, China has stepped up its lands claims through military incursions.
China’s new stridency underscores Asia’s central diplomatic challenge: coming to terms with existing boundaries by shedding the baggage of history that burdens all of the region’s important inter-state relationships.
Even as Asia is becoming more interdependent economically, it is becoming more politically divided.
A number of inter-state wars were fought in Asia since 1950, the year that both the Korean War and the annexation of Tibet started.
But, whereas the Europe’s bloody wars in the first half of the twentieth century have made war there unthinkable today, the wars in Asia in the second half of the twentieth century, far from settling or ending disputes, only accentuated bitter rivalries.
China, significantly, has been involved in the largest number of military conflicts in Asia.
A recent Pentagon report is unsparing: “The history of modern Chinese warfare provides numerous case studies in which China’s leaders have claimed military preemption as a strategically defensive act.
For example, China refers to its intervention in the Korean War (1950-1953) as the ‘War to Resist the United States and Aid Korea.’
Similarly, authoritative texts refer to border conflicts against India (1962), the Soviet Union (1969), and Vietnam (1979) as ‘Self-Defense Counter Attacks.’” The seizure of the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974 by Chinese forces was another example of offense as defense.
All these cases of preemption occurred when China was weak, poor, and internally torn.
So the growing power of today’s China naturally raises legitimate concerns.
Having earlier preached the gospel of its “peaceful rise,” China no longer is shy about showcasing its military capabilities and asserting itself on multiple fronts.
With the Chinese Communist Party increasingly dependent on the military to maintain its monopoly on power and ensure domestic order, senior military officers are overtly influencing foreign policy.
The result is a growing territorial assertiveness, which has become a source of new friction along China’s land and sea frontiers. That, in turn, has put China at the center of Asia’s political divides.
Several developments this year underscore China’s more muscular foreign policy, from its inclusion of the South China Sea in its “core” national interests – a move that makes its claims to the disputed Spratly Islands non-negotiable – to its reference to the Yellow Sea as a sort of exclusive Chinese military-operations zone.
The US and South Korea should, according to Chinese officials, discontinue holding joint naval exercises there, apparently out of respect for China’s new power.
China also has become more insistent in pressing its territorial claims both to India’s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state and to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, with Chinese warships making more frequent forays into Japanese waters.
Indian defense officials have reported a sharp increase in Chinese military incursions across the disputed 4,057-kilometer Himalayan frontier and in aggressive patrolling.
China also has started questioning Indian sovereignty over the state of Jammu and Kashmir, one-fifth of which it occupied following the Tibet annexation.
Beijing’s 2004 spat with South Korea over the ancient kingdom of Koguryo – triggered by a revised historical claim posted on the Chinese foreign ministry’s Web site that the empire, founded in the Tongge river basin of northern Korea, was Chinese – was seen as an attempt to hedge China’s options vis-à-vis a potentially unified Korea.
By signaling that the present China-North Korea border may not be final, Beijing has raised the specter of potential tensions over frontiers in the future.
Against that background, China’s increasingly assertive territorial and maritime claims threaten Asian peace and stability.
In fact, the largest real estate China covets is not in the South or East China Seas: India’s Arunachal Pradesh is almost three times larger than Taiwan.
Respect for boundaries is a prerequisite to peace and stability on any continent.
Europe has built its peace on that principle, with a number of European states learning to live with boundaries that they don’t like.
But the Chinese Communist Party still harps on old grievances to reinforce its claim to legitimacy: full restoration of China’s “dignity” after a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.
Through its overt refusal to accept Asia’s territorial status quo, China only highlights the futility of political negotiations.
After all, frontiers are never significantly redrawn at the negotiating table, but only on the battlefield, as China has shown in the past.
Today, whether it is Arunachal Pradesh or Taiwan or the Senkaku Islands or even the Spratlys, China is dangling the threat of force to assert its claims.
By picking territorial fights with its neighbors, China is not only reinforcing old rivalries, but is also threatening Asia’s continued economic renaissance – showing that it is not a credible candidate to lead Asia.
It is important for other Asian states and the US – a “resident power” in Asia, in the words of US Defense Secretary Robert Gates – to convey a clear message to China: a peaceful rise and unilateral redrawing of frontiers don’t mix.
A Security Strategy for the 21st Century
MADRID – “Time and again in our Nation’s history, Americans have risen to meet –and to shape – moments of transition.
This must be one of those moments.” So begins the National Security Strategy of the United States of America, presented before Congress on May 27.
As with the politics pursued in the Obama administration’s 16 months of office – dialogue, international commitment, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament – the document’s strength lies in the position that it takes.
The Security Strategy is a clear departure from that of its predecessor and offers a wider conception of what national security represents for US President Barack Obama.
In the face of the major challenges of our times, Obama has taken a stand with a comprehensive doctrine.
Indeed, the Security Strategy is almost a “National” Strategy.
Its thinking goes beyond the dominant, unilateral paradigm of its predecessor and includes a defense of international law.
This is particularly noteworthy, given that none of the great treaties to create an international criminal court and a permanent war-crimes tribunal was signed by the US during George W. Bush’s presidency.  
Obama’s approach to security is broader as well, proposing the “three Ds” – defense, diplomacy, and development – as indivisible parts of a whole.
The military dimension of intervention abroad loses its privileged role, making way for the prevention of conflict and for peace-keeping and stabilization missions.
In the fight against terrorism, the Strategy abandons the predominantly military viewpoint underlying the war against terror, and embraces a more significant role for the intelligence services.
For the first time, precise reference is made to people liable to be a threat to US security.
The US is not waging a war against terrorism; it is at “war against a specific network, al Qaida, and its affiliates.”
In this war, information resources are particularly necessary.
In order to guarantee national security, the Strategy is categorical – without giving in to the temptation of isolationism – in admitting the strategic value of the example and the importance of doing one’s homework first.
Obama steers clear both of interventions for humanitarian purposes and of attempting to export democracy by force.
There is no better way of exporting the values of democracy than by strengthening the US internally.
Thus, an economic policy that tackles America’s debt and deficit makes up the main portion of the Strategy.
Backing competitive education, innovation, technology, energy, and a more efficient and accessible health-care system complements and reinforces Obama’s leadership approach of setting an example with one’s own policies.
An important example is removing the US prison at Guantánamo Bay from international limbo – one of his first initiatives as president.
This approach does not have unanimous support among international experts.
The two main criticisms – lack of strategic clarity and less emphasis on the classical concepts of power – point to America’s loss of influence, power, and leadership.
But these criticisms reflect an inability to contemplate the current nature of armed conflict, which no longer follows the classical logic of military victory or defeat.
The war in Afghanistan and the complex situation in Iraq have highlighted the importance of a comprehensive approach.
Military action cannot be considered the only variable of success.
A successful strategy should use civilian means – incidentally a model advocated by the European Union.
We are faced with forging a new long-term policy that affects both states and societies.
That task requires patience and strategic perseverance.
Change will not occur from one day to the next, but the results obtained in the end will be better and more enduring.
Obama maintains the idea of service to a historical mission for the US: the important job of guaranteeing global security.
But, unlike his White House predecessors, Obama’s National Security Strategy recognizes the value of partnerships; attaches greater importance to the civilian dimension as opposed to the military; and stresses the value of dialogue and the need to reinforce international institutions.
This is a good sign for a world with different power centers and interests, with resources and legitimacy remaining tied to the nation-state, but in which challenges (climate change, armed conflicts, pandemics, and transnational crime) are global and, therefore, require cooperation among states.
We are in a transition period: international interconnection is increasing, as the global economic crisis has shown, but the management tools and mechanisms to guarantee the smooth operation of governments are still not being shared.
Obama’s new National Security Strategy shows a political willingness to back an international order able to tackle these challenges.
The road ahead is not free of difficulties, but the Strategy represents a decisive step towards solving the challenges of the twenty-first century and preparing us for the world of tomorrow.
A Seismic Crime
NEW YORK – Few people outside Italy are aware that six seismologists and a government official are on trial in the small city of L’Aquila.
But the story has implications for scientists, engineers, administrators, and legal systems far beyond Italy’s borders.
L’Aquila was largely destroyed by earthquakes in 1461 and 1703.
The city was rebuilt, eventually grew to more than 73,000 inhabitants, and remained stable for more than 300 years – until October 2008, when tremors began again.
From January 1 through April 5, 2009, 304 additional tremors were reported.
Italy’s National Commission for Prediction and Prevention of Major Risks, which comprised the seven men now on trial, met in L’Aquila for one hour on March 31, 2009, to assess the earthquake swarms.
According to the minutes, Enzo Boschi, President of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, was asked if they were precursors to an earthquake resembling the one in 1703.
He replied: “It is unlikely that an earthquake like the one in 1703 could occur in the short term, but the possibility cannot be totally excluded.”
On April 6, 2009, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck L’Aquila and nearby towns, killing more than 300 people and injuring more than 1,500.
The quake also destroyed roughly 20,000 buildings, temporarily displacing another 65,000 people.
More than a year later, in July 2010, prosecutor Fabio Picuti charged the Commission members with manslaughter and negligence for failing to warn the public of the impending risk.
The trial began last September, and is expected to last for months, if not years.
After Picuti made the charges public in June 2010, Alan Leshner, Executive Publisher of Science, sent an open letter of protest to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
He wrote that the “charges against these scientists are both unfair and naïve….[T]here is no accepted scientific method for earthquake prediction that can be reliably used to warn citizens of an impending disaster.”
The American Geophysical Union and thousands of other scientists also objected.
Picuti reportedly responded: “I’m not crazy.
I know they can’t predict earthquakes.
The basis of the charges is not that they didn’t predict the earthquake.
As functionaries of the state, they had certain duties imposed by law: to evaluate and characterize the risks that were present in L’Aquila.”
In 1989, a United States National Research Council report, Improving Risk Communication, recommended that one-way communication from experts to non-experts be replaced with an “interactive process of exchange of information and opinion.”
The report suggested that risk communication is successful only if those involved are satisfied that they are adequately informed about the relevant issues, given the limits of available knowledge.
Yet such information exchange remains a problem – and not only in Italy – more than 20 years later.
The interactions between science, technology, and law are growing increasingly complex.
As science and technologies evolve, risk assessments and the dialogue between scientists and governments must adapt.
Both sides must continually determine, before disaster strikes, whether existing laws provide scientists and administrators with clear, realistic standards for their analyses and public communications.
If they do not, the best qualified scientists and administrators might be frightened away.
In 2011, the National Research Council and the US Federal Judicial Center issued the 1,016-page third edition of the Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence.
Although its purpose is to help judges and attorneys to understand the science from which legal evidence is derived, its index contains no entry for earthquakes. Furthermore, the manual mentions risk communication only briefly, in the context of medical testimony.
Given such shortcomings, courses on science and engineering and their social applications should become part of the core training and continuing education of those in law, public administration, and official policymaking positions.
Legislators, prosecutors, and judges, in particular, need to understand what natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering can and cannot offer.
At the same time, natural scientists must become better educated to work effectively with engineers, public administrators, and social scientists (for example, economists, demographers, and psychologists) to communicate the consequences of scientific findings, especially when high risks are involved.
Those risks will not go away.
In February 2011, almost 200 people died when a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand.
The following month, Japan’s Tōhoku earthquake killed almost 16,000 people.
As the anniversary of that earthquake approaches on March 11, Japanese researchers predicted in January 2012 that another major earthquake will strike the southern Kanto region, including Tokyo, by 2016 with 70% probability.
The Big One will one day strike California.
Will we be ready?
A Solution Now for Cyprus
NEW YORK – For four decades, Ledra Street in the heart of Nicosia had been a symbol of a divided Cyprus.
And then, two years ago this April, the wall that split the capital into north and south was opened.
Slowly, people who had not mingled for 44 years began to renew their ties and rediscover one another.
It was a window onto what the future might bring.
Last week, I visited the Ledra Street crossing.
Officially, I was there to inaugurate a reconstruction plan for buildings that had fallen into disrepair in the old buffer zone.
More personally, I wanted to see for myself the divide that for too long had kept Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots apart.
As I walked the street, people from both communities crowded around and began chanting, “Solution now!
Solution now!”
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });As a Korean, I know only too well the pain of a land divided.
I also know how difficult reconciliation can be.
That is why I went to Cyprus – to show my personal support for the efforts to reunify the island, and to push for further progress.
Cyprus is at a critical juncture.
The Greek Cypriot leader, Demetris Christofias, and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Mehmet Ali Talat, are working hard to reach an agreement.
But it will elude them without a further concerted push.
The United Nations is in Cyprus to help however it can.UN Peacekeepers have stood watch for more than 45 years.
My envoy, Alexander Downer, is facilitating the negotiations.
I had lengthy discussions with both leaders – individually and together – and told them that the destiny of Cyprus is entirely in their hands.
I believe that a solution is within reach.
First, there is a strong, shared commitment between Christofias and Talat.
They have met almost 70 times over the past 16 months, including two weeks of intensive talks immediately prior to my visit.
Second, negotiators are finding common ground.
While I was there, the leaders joined together in highlighting progress that they have already made on crucial issues such as governance and power-sharing.
Third, both sides are staying at the table.
As the leaders have said, “Time is not on the side of settlement.”
That is why they have committed to continue their talks, rather than pause ahead of the upcoming elections in the north in April.
Finally, Greece and Turkey – the two key regional actors – support the current talks and are willing to be helpful in finding a solution.
Building on this momentum is vital.
No one is under the illusion that any of this is easy – peace negotiations never are.
The issues are exceedingly complex and embedded in a troubled history.
There will be skeptics and critics every step, and there will be those who seek to divert or derail the process in pursuit of their own interests and agendas.
Courage and conviction will be required of leaders to do what they know to be right.
Any agreement will face a popular referendum within both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
Yet it is clear that a solution to the Cyprus problem would be overwhelmingly in the interests of the island’s people, North and South.
A settlement would alsosend a message to the world that disputes as long-standing and complex as that in Cyprus can be resolved peacefully.
That is why, despite all the obstacles, the negotiators must persevere along the road to peace.
The people’s call on Ledra Street must be heard.
For Cyprus, it is time for a “solution now.”
A Squandered Golden Opportunity
PALO ALTO – A group of multi-national European scientists has used gene-splicing techniques to create an extraordinary tomato.
It boasts a deep purple skin and flesh, and contains levels of antioxidants 200% higher than unmodified tomatoes.
When fed to highly cancer-susceptible mice, the tomatoes significantly extended the mice’s lifespan.
These studies have received wide attention, but an equally momentous achievement of genetic modification has been largely ignored for almost a decade.
That innovation is “Golden Rice,” a collection of new rice varieties that is bio-fortified, or enriched, by genes that express beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, which is converted in the body, as needed, to the active form.
Most physicians in North America and Europe never see a single case of vitamin A deficiency in their professional lifetimes.
But the situation is very different in poor countries, where vitamin A deficiency is epidemic among the poor, whose diet is heavily dominated by rice (which contains neither beta-carotene nor vitamin A) or other carbohydrate-rich, vitamin-poor sources of calories.
In developing countries, 200-300 million children of preschool age are at risk of vitamin A deficiency, which can be devastating and even fatal.
It increases susceptibility to common childhood infections such as measles and diarrheal diseases, and is the single most important cause of childhood blindness in developing countries.
Every year, about 500,000 children become blind as a result of vitamin A deficiency, and 70% die within a year of losing their sight.
In theory, we could simply supplement children’s diets with vitamin A in capsules, or add it to some staple foodstuff, the way that we add iodine to table salt to prevent hypothyroidism and goiter.
Unfortunately, neither the resources – hundreds of millions of dollars annually – nor the infrastructure for distribution are available.
Biotechnology offers a better, cheaper, and more feasible solution: Golden Rice, which incorporates beta-carotene into the genetically altered rice grains.
The concept is simple.
Although rice plants do not normally synthesize beta-carotene in the endosperm (seeds), they do make it in the green portions of the plant.
By using gene-splicing techniques to introduce the two genes that express these enzymes, the pathway is restored and the rice grains accumulate therapeutic amounts of beta-carotene. 
Golden Rice offers the potential to make contributions to human health and welfare as monumental as the discovery and distribution of the Salk polio vaccine.
With wide use, it could save hundreds of thousands of lives every year and enhance the quality of life for millions more.
But one aspect of this shining story is tarnished.
Intransigent opposition by anti-science, anti-technology activists – Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and a few other groups – has spurred already risk-averse regulators to adopt an overly cautious approach that has stalled approvals.
There is absolutely nothing about Golden Rice that should require endless case-by-case reviews and bureaucratic dithering.
As the British journal Nature argued in 1992, a broad scientific consensus holds that “the same physical and biological laws govern the response of organisms modified by modern molecular and cellular methods and those produced by classical methods....
[Therefore] no conceptual distinction exists between genetic modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify DNA and transfer genes.”
Put another way, government regulation of field research with plants should focus on the traits that may be related to risk – invasiveness, weediness, toxicity, and so forth – rather than on whether one or another technique of genetic manipulation was used.
Nine years after its creation, despite its vast potential to benefit humanity – and a negligible probability of harm to human health or the environment – Golden Rice remains hung up in regulatory red tape, with no end in sight. (Cancer-preventing tomatoes, take notice.) 
By contrast, plants constructed with less precise techniques such as hybridization or mutagenesis generally are subject to no government scrutiny or requirements (or opposition from activists) at all.
That applies even to the numerous new plant varieties that have resulted from “wide crosses,” hybridizations that move genes from one species or genus to another – across what used to be considered natural breeding boundaries.
Judith Rodin, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, announced last October that her organization will provide funding to the International Rice Research Institute to shepherd Golden Rice through national regulatory approval processes in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
This is good news, but what is really needed is a multi-faceted, aggressive reform of the regulatory process so that all new genetic constructions will have a chance to succeed.
In an April editorial in the journal Science , Nina Fedoroff, an eminent plant geneticist who serves as senior scientific advisor to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, wrote: “A new Green Revolution demands a global commitment to creating a modern agricultural infrastructure everywhere, adequate investment in training and modern laboratory facilities, and progress toward simplified regulatory approaches that are responsive to accumulating evidence of safety.
The Golden Rice story makes it clear that we do not yet have the will and the wisdom to make that happen.
A Star is Jailed
BANGKOK – Joseph Estrada, the disgraced former president of the Philippines, faces the prospect of spending his remaining years in prison after a special court in Manila found him guilty of amassing around US$15 million in bribes and kickbacks.
During the 30 months he ruled his country, from mid-1998 to the start of 2001, Estrada accepted payoffs from gambling lords and orchestrated (with social security funds) sales of stocks, channeling much of the profits into his personal aliased account.
Estrada literally defined plunder: as a senator in the early 1990’s, he was a member of the congress that crafted the law under which he was convicted.
For many Filipinos, there is more than enough poetry in this fact, and certainly more irony than Estrada’s action-comedy movies of the 1960’s ever mustered.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });There is no underplaying the significance of the court’s unanimous decision to convict the first Philippine president ever to undergo a criminal trial.
This is, after all, the Philippines, where Imelda Marcos is still living free and easy.
Despite massive evidence of the widespread death, poverty, suffering, and dysfunction she and her late husband, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, inflicted on the Philippines, the only real disappointment she has subsequently endured has been losing the last presidential election she was allowed to contest.
The Philippines is not a country used to seeing powerful people punished.
When officials are accused or suspected of corruption, they do not quickly resign, as in Korea or Japan.
Instead, they often seek immunity by running for public office.
When a bloody coup against Corazon Aquino’s fledgling democratic government failed, the leader of the putsch escaped from a floating prison – and then successfully ran for senator.
The wheels of Philippine justice need retooling, so much so that the country’s Chief Justice himself recently called for an emergency summit to discuss a rash of extra-judicial killings that have the claimed the lives of leftists, human rights workers, and journalists under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
There have been few convictions for these crimes.
Yet Filipinos themselves simply cannot seem to imagine their leaders behind bars.
Even before Estrada’s conviction, opinion polls showed that 48% of Filipinos wanted clemency, if not a guaranteed pardon from Arroyo.
More than 80% said Estrada should be allowed to languish in a lush private family vacation home where he already spent the last six years awaiting his verdict.
Is this lack of appetite for justice a part of Filipino culture, or learned behavior?
Has an overly forgiving nature prevented Filipinos from achieving closure in so many painful chapters of their history, or are the ravages of impunity to blame?
With so few examples of justice clearly dispensed, and overwhelmed by examples of villains so easily forgiven or forgotten, perhaps Filipinos could not bring themselves to demand what they could not imagine.
Estrada’s conviction gives Filipinos the clearest illustration of what the rule of law may bring to their society.
Estrada remains adored by the masses, but so far the public’s reaction to the verdict has been nonviolent and almost subdued.
Notwithstanding the opinion polls, it does seem as though the public not only accepts his conviction, but that they respect it as the outcome of a fair system that has been allowed to work.
This suggests not only that justice in the Philippines has a chance; equally important, it suggests that Filipinos will give justice a chance.
If the Estrada saga leads to a firm yet dignified exercise of justice, Filipinos may discover a taste for more of the same.
Europe’s Lost Keynesians
CAMBRIDGE – There is no magic Keynesian bullet for the eurozone’s woes.
But the spectacularly muddle-headed argument nowadays that too much austerity is killing Europe is not surprising.
Commentators are consumed by politics, flailing away at any available target, while the “anti-austerity” masses apparently believe that there are easy cyclical solutions to tough structural problems.
The eurozone’s difficulties, I have long argued, stem from European financial and monetary integration having gotten too far ahead of actual political, fiscal, and banking union.
This is not a problem with which Keynes was familiar, much less one that he sought to address.
Above all, any realistic strategy for dealing with the eurozone crisis must involve massive write-downs (forgiveness) of peripheral countries’ debt.
These countries’ massive combined bank and government debt – the distinction everywhere in Europe has become blurred – makes rapid sustained growth a dream.
This is hardly the first time I have stressed the need for wholesale debt write-downs.
Two years ago, in a commentary called “The Euro’s Pig-Headed Masters,” I wrote that “Europe is in constitutional crisis.
No one seems to have the power to impose a sensible resolution of its peripheral countries’ debt crisis.
Instead of restructuring the manifestly unsustainable debt burdens of Portugal, Ireland, and Greece (the PIGs), politicians and policymakers are pushing for ever-larger bailout packages with ever-less realistic austerity conditions.”
My sometime co-author Carmen Reinhart makes the same point, perhaps even more clearly.
In a May 2010 Washington Post editorial (co-authored with Vincent Reinhart), she described “Five Myths About the European Debt Crisis” – among them, “Myth #3: Fiscal austerity will solve Europe’s debt woes.”
We have repeated the mantra dozens of times in various settings, as any fair observer would confirm.
In a debt restructuring, the northern eurozone countries (including France) will see hundreds of billions of euros go up in smoke.
Northern taxpayers will be forced to inject massive amounts of capital into banks, even if the authorities impose significant losses on banks’ large and wholesale creditors, as well they should.
These hundreds of billions of euros are already lost, and the game of pretending otherwise cannot continue indefinitely.
A gentler way to achieve some modest reduction in public and private debt burdens would be to commit to a period of sustained but moderate inflation, as I recommended in December 2008 in a commentary entitled “Inflation is Now the Lesser Evil.”
Sustained moderate inflation would help to bring down the real value of real estate more quickly, and potentially make it easier for German wages to rise faster than those in peripheral countries.
It would have been a great idea four and a half years ago.
It remains a good idea today.
What else needs to happen?
The other steps involve economic restructuring at the national level and political integration of the eurozone.
In another commentary, “A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold,” I concluded that “without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade.”
Here, all eyes may be on Germany, but today it is really France that will play the central role in deciding the euro’s fate.
Germany cannot carry the euro on its shoulders alone indefinitely.
France needs to become a second anchor of growth and stability.
Temporary Keynesian demand measures may help to sustain short-run internal growth, but they will not solve France’s long-run competitiveness problems.
At the same time, France and Germany must both come to terms with an approach that leads to far greater political union within a couple of decades.
Otherwise, the coming banking union and fiscal transfers will lack the necessary political legitimacy.
As my colleague Jeffrey Frankel has remarked, for more than 20 years, Germany’s elites have insisted that the eurozone will not be a transfer union.
But, in the end, ordinary Germans have been proved right, and the elites have been proved wrong.
Indeed, if the eurozone is to survive, the northern countries will have to continue to help the periphery with new loans until access to private markets is restored.
So, given that Germany will be picking up many more bills (regardless of whether the eurozone survives), how can it best use the strength of its balance sheet to alleviate Europe’s growth problems?
Certainly, Germany must continue to acquiesce in an ever-larger role for the European Central Bank, despite the obvious implicit fiscal risks.
There is no safe path forward.
There are a number of schemes floating around for leveraging Germany’s lower borrowing costs to help its partner countries, beyond simply expanding the ECB’s balance sheet.
For meaningful burden-sharing to work, however, eurozone leaders must stop dreaming that the single currency can survive another 20 or 30 years without much greater political union.
Debt write-downs and guarantees will inevitably bloat Germany’s government debt, as the authorities are forced to bail out German banks (and probably some neighboring countries’ banks).
But the sooner the underlying reality is made transparent and becomes widely recognized, the lower the long-run cost will be.
To my mind, using Germany’s balance sheet to help its neighbors directly is far more likely to work than is the presumed “trickle-down” effect of a German-led fiscal expansion.
This, unfortunately, is what has been lost in the debate about Europe of late: However loud and aggressive the anti-austerity movement becomes, there still will be no simple Keynesian cure for the single currency’s debt and growth woes.
A Survival Strategy for the Eurozone
NEW YORK – After the Greek and Irish crises and the spread of financial contagion to Portugal, Spain, and possibly even Italy, the eurozone is now in a serious crisis.
There are three possible scenarios: “muddle through,” based on the current approach of “lend and pray”; “break-up,” with disorderly debt restructurings and possible exit of weaker members; and “greater integration,” implying some form of fiscal union.
The muddle-through scenario – with financing provided to member states in distress (conditional on fiscal adjustment and structural reforms), in the hope that they are illiquid but solvent – is an unstable disequilibrium.
Indeed, it could lead to the disorderly breakup scenario if institutional reforms and other policies leading to closer integration and restoration of growth in the eurozone’s periphery are not implemented soon.
The crisis started with too much private debt and leverage, which became public debt and deficits as crisis and recession triggered fiscal deterioration and private losses were mostly socialized via bailouts of financial systems.
Then, distressed sovereigns that had already lost market access – Greece and Ireland – were bailed out by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
But no one will bail out these super-sovereigns if the sovereigns prove to be insolvent.
Thus, the current strategy of kicking the can down the road will soon reach its limits, and a different plan will be needed to save the eurozone.
The first institutional reform takes the form of a larger envelope of official resources, which would mean a quasi-fiscal union.
Official resources currently are sufficient to bail out Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, but not to prevent a self-fulfilling run on the short-term sovereign and financial liabilities of Spain and other potentially distressed eurozone members.
So, even if these countries were to implement the necessary fiscal and structural reforms, an increase of official resources would nonetheless be needed.
Because nervous investors don’t want to be last in line in case of a run, a disorderly rush to the exits is likely when official resources are insufficient.
Short of full fiscal unification – or a variant of it in the form of eurozone bonds – this increase in official resources would occur through a much-enlarged European Financial Stability Facility and a much greater commitment by the European Central Bank to long-term bond purchases and liquidity operations to support banks.
Since quasi-fiscal union implies that the eurozone’s core economies could end up systematically bailing out those on the periphery, only a formal loss of fiscal sovereignty – a credible commitment by the peripheral countries to medium- and long-term fiscal discipline – could overcome the current political resistance of Germany and others.
But even a larger envelope of official resources is not sufficient to stem the insolvency problems of Greece, Ireland, and, possibly, Portugal and Spain.
Thus, a second set of policies and institutional reforms requires that all unsecured creditors of banks and other financial institutions need to be “treated” – that is, they must accept losses (or “haircuts”) on their claims.
This is needed to prevent even more private debt being put on government balance sheets, causing a fiscal blowout.
If orderly treatment of unsecured senior creditors requires a new cross-border regime to close down insolvent European banks, such a regime should be implemented without delay.
Similarly, super-sovereigns cannot continue to bail out distressed sovereigns that are insolvent rather than illiquid.
Thus, in addition to an orderly resolution regime for banks, Europe must also implement early orderly restructurings of distressed sovereigns’ public debt.
Waiting until 2013 to implement these restructurings, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposes, will destroy confidence, as it implies a much larger haircut on residual private claims on sovereign borrowers.
Thus, orderly market-based restructurings via exchange offers need to occur in 2011.
Such exchange offers can limit private creditors’ losses if they are done early.
That way, formal haircuts on the face value of debt can be avoided via new bonds that include only a maturity extension and an interest-rate cap that is set below today’s unsustainable market rates.
Waiting to restructure unsustainable debts would only lead to disorderly workouts and severe haircuts for some private creditors.
Finally, Europe needs policies that restore competitiveness and growth to the eurozone’s periphery, where GDP is either still contracting (Greece, Spain, and Ireland) or barely growing (Italy and Portugal).
Without growth, it will be difficult to stabilize public and private debts and deficits as a share of GDP – the most important indicator of fiscal sustainability.
Moreover, without growth, the social and political backlash against painful belt-tightening will eventually undermine austerity and reform.
Unfortunately, fiscal austerity and structural reforms are – at least in the short run – recessionary and deflationary. So other policies are needed to restore growth.
The ECB should pursue a much looser monetary policy to jump-start growth, with a weaker euro to help boost the periphery’s competitiveness.
In addition, Germany should delay its fiscal consolidation; if anything, it should cut taxes for a couple of years to boost its own growth and – via trade – that of the periphery.
In the next few months, it will become clear whether European policymakers can compromise and implement reforms that dampen the threat of a eurozone breakup.
Either the EU moves in the direction of a more stable equilibrium of closer integration, or the risk of an unstable and disorderly breakup scenario will rise significantly.
A Sustainable Housing Recovery?
NEW HAVEN – Volatility in the housing market has long been known, but until now it has never been visible in so many places around the world at the same time.
Indeed, the year 2009 might even be a milestone marking a new era of volatility.
Since 2000, we have seen the most dramatic evidence ever of speculative bubbles in markets for owner-occupied homes.
Home prices exploded after 2000 in North America, Europe, and Asia, and in many isolated places elsewhere in the world.
Markets peaked in 2007, and then fell sharply in many of these places with the onset of the global financial crisis.
Surprisingly, prices rebounded in some places in 2009.
It seems the story never ends.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In the United States, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 10-City Home Price Index recorded the biggest turnaround since the index began in 1987, rising 5% (a 15% annual rate) from April to August 2009, after having fallen 7% (a 21% annual rate) in the four months from December 2008 to March 2009.
Recent increases in home prices have also been seen in Australia, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Sweden, and optimistic talk is heard in still more places.
Housing prices are on a rollercoaster ride, and we may never be able to make complete sense of their movements, other than to understand the volatility that they represent.
Indeed, in a volatile speculative market, where people buy and sell in anticipation of further price movements, history confirms that price movements will be hard to explain, even after the fact.
They reflect changing investor psychology, which is hard to discern, and new information, which may still be amorphous and ambiguous.
This surge in volatility appears to reflect a new and different attitude toward homes as an asset – an attitude that has spread around much of the world.
We used to think that homes were in the same category as automobiles: depreciating assets that grow obsolete over time, are costly to maintain, and go out of style, eventually to be scrapped and replaced.
Now we think of them as claims on increasingly scarce resources in a rapidly growing world, with prices potentially skyrocketing any day.
It used to be commonly thought that a home’s value consists primarily in the structure, not in the land on which it sits.
This should be increasingly true as high-rise condominiums become more common.
In some cases 100 homes can, in effect, be stacked on one another.
With such intensive use of land, our land constraints for housing construction are vanishingly small.
This long-term trend towards multifamily housing may be expected to continue, further diminishing the importance of land to home values.
But the recent speculative bubbles have in effect boosted the percentage of land value in home value.
Although much of this was temporary, we now tend to think of homes as land rather than structures.
Economists usually compute urban land value by subtracting the estimated construction cost of the home from the home price, so that land value is inferred as a residual.
Economists do this because in most places direct sales of vacant urban land are rare, and often involve unusual places or unusual circumstances, that make such sales unrepresentative of land values underneath homes.
Thus, the bubble component in home prices is attributed to a surge in land prices, even though land prices outside of bubbly urban areas are vastly lower.
Many people appear to believe that upswings in home prices reflect increasing scarcity of land in a world constrained by rapid economic growth and severe resource constraints (symbolized by the fear of global warming).
They view the recent collapse of the housing bubble as merely the effect of a temporary financial crisis, which governments around the world seem to be confronting aggressively.
Such thinking may be playing a part in the recent rebound of home prices.
But in fact, it is probably more accurate to think of the ups and downs of the world’s housing markets as a reflection of the change in our thinking about housing as an investment.
If so, the volatility in home prices after 2000 was the result of faulty thinking, not of the natural effects of global economic growth, which has occurred at a relatively smooth rate for decades now.
Faulty thinking, in turn, encouraged loose practices by mortgage lenders, and led central banks to take no action against housing bubbles as they developed.
In many countries, governments in 2009 responded to the collapse of housing bubbles by instituting policies aimed at supporting these speculative markets.
The result, however, has been to lead people to add another, political, component to their assessment of home prices, unhinging them further from economic fundamentals.
A basic fact is often forgotten: the modern construction industry is quite capable of building vast numbers of fine modern homes, including units in high-rise buildings, at costs far below the prices of homes in many urban areas today.
This should put a break on long-run escalation of home prices.
Housing speculators seem often to be betting on the political equilibrium that restricts the supply of housing, and on the indefinite continuation of the artificial supports started during this financial crisis.
But, in a newly global economy, with increasing interregional and international population flows and widespread commitment to economic freedom, it is very hard for governments to restrict supply in the long run.
That is why it appears safer to predict high volatility in 2010 than to predict that home prices will rise.
A Sustainable Recovery
NEW YORK – The global recession now underway is the result not only of a financial panic, but also of more basic uncertainty about the future direction of the world economy.
Consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they have suffered a blow to their wealth with declining stock prices and housing values, but also because they don’t know where to turn.
Should they risk buying a new car when gasoline prices might soar again?
Will they be able to put food on the table after this year’s terrifying rise in food prices?
Decisions about business investment are even starker.
Businesses are reluctant to invest at a time when consumer demand is plummeting and they face unprecedented risk penalties on their borrowing costs.
They are also facing huge uncertainties.
What kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future?
Will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide as in the past?
Can the United States still afford a suburban lifestyle, with sprawling homes in far-flung communities that require long-distance automobile commutes? 
To a large extent, economic recovery will depend on a much clearer sense of the direction of future economic change. That is largely the job of government.
After the confused and misguided leadership of the Bush administration, which failed to give any clear path to energy, health, climate, and financial policies, President-elect Barack Obama will have to start charting a course that defines the American economy’s future direction.
The US is not the only economy in this equation.
We need a global vision of sustainable recovery that includes leadership from China, India, Europe, Latin America, and, yes, even Africa, long marginalized from the world economy, but very much part of it now.
There are a few clear points amidst the large uncertainties and confusions.
First, the US cannot continue borrowing from the rest of the world as it has for the past eight years.
America’s net exports will have to increase, meaning that the net exports of China, Japan, and other surplus countries will consequently decrease.
The adjustments needed amount to a sizeable deficit-to-balance swing of around $700 billion in the US current account, or nearly 5% of US GNP.
China’s trade surplus might shrink by half of that amount (with cuts in trade surpluses also spread over other global regions), meaning a shift in Chinese GNP toward internal demand and away from net exports equal to between 5% and 10% of China’s GNP.
Fortunately, China is promoting a major domestic expansion. 
Second, the decline in US consumption should also be partly offset by a rise in US investment.
However, private business will not step up investment unless there is a clear policy direction for the economy.
Obama has emphasized the need for a “green recovery,” that is, one based on sustainable technologies, not merely on consumption spending.
The US auto industry should be re-tooled for low-carbon-emission automobiles, either plug-in hybrids or pure battery-operated vehicles.
Either technology will depend on a national electricity grid that uses low-emission forms of power generation, such as wind, solar, nuclear, or coal-fired plants that capture and store the carbon-dioxide emissions.
All of these technologies will require public funding alongside private investment.   
Third, the US recovery will not be credible unless there is also a strategy for getting the government’s own finances back in order.
George W. Bush’s idea of economic policy was to cut taxes three times while boosting spending on war.
The result is a massive budget deficit, which will expand to gargantuan proportions in the coming year (perhaps $1 trillion) under the added weight of recession, bank bailouts, and short-term fiscal stimulus measures.
Obama will need to put forward a medium-term fiscal plan that restores government finances.
This will include ending the war in Iraq, raising taxes on the rich, and also gradually phasing in new consumption taxes.
The US currently collects the lowest ratio of taxes to national income among rich nations.
This will have to change. 
Fourth, the world’s poor regions need to be seen as investment opportunities, not as threats or places to ignore.
At a time when the major infrastructure companies of the US, Europe, and Japan will have serious excess capacity, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, the US Export-Import Bank, the African Development Bank, and other public investment funds should be financing large-scale infrastructure spending in Africa, to build roads, power plants, ports, and telecommunications systems.
So long as the credits are long term and carry a modest interest rate (say, 25-year dollar loans at 5% per annum), the recipient countries could repay the loans out of the significant boost in incomes that would result over the course of a generation.
The benefits would be extraordinary, for both Africa and the rich countries, which would be putting their businesses and skilled workers back to work.
Such loans, of course, would require a major global initiative, at a time when even blue-chip companies cannot borrow overnight, much less for 25 years!
In typical business cycles, countries are usually left to manage the recovery largely on their own.
This time we will need global cooperation.
Recovery will require major shifts in trade imbalances, technologies, and public budgets.
These large-scale changes will have to be coordinated, at least informally if not tightly, among the major economies.
Each should understand the basic directions of change that will be required at the national level and globally, and all nations must share in the deployment of new sustainable technologies and in the co-financing of global responsibilities, such as increased investments in African infrastructure.
We have arrived at a moment in history when cooperative global political leadership is more important than ever.
Fortunately, the US has taken a huge step forward with Obama’s election.
Now to action.
A Tale of Two American Economies
NEW YORK – While the United States recently reported 3.5% GDP growth in the third quarter, suggesting that the most severe recession since the Great Depression is over, the American economy is actually much weaker than official data suggest.
But official measures of GDP may grossly overstate growth in the economy as they don't capture the fact that business sentiment among small firms is abysmal and their output is still falling sharply.
Third quarter GDP - properly corrected for these factors - may have been 2% rather than 3.5%.
The story of the US is, indeed, one of two economies.  There is a smaller one that is slowly recovering and a larger one that is still in a deep and persistent downturn.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Consider the following facts.
While America’s official unemployment rate is already 10.2%, the figure jumps to a whopping 17.5% when discouraged workers and partially employed workers are included.
And, while data from firms suggest that job losses in the last three months were about 600,000, household surveys, which include self-employed workers and small entrepreneurs, suggest that those losses were above two million.
Moreover, the total effect on labor income – the product of jobs times hours worked times average hourly wages – has been more severe than that implied by the job losses alone, because many firms are cutting their workers’ hours, placing them on furlough, or lowering their wages as a way to share the pain.
Many of the lost jobs – in construction, finance, and outsourced manufacturing and services – are gone forever, and recent studies suggest that a quarter of US jobs can be fully outsourced over time to other countries.
Thus, a growing proportion of the workforce – often below the radar screen of official statistics – is losing hope of finding gainful employment, while the unemployment rate (especially for poor, unskilled workers) will remain high for a much longer period of time than in previous recessions.
Consider also the credit markets.
Prime borrowers with good credit scores and investment-grade firms are not experiencing a credit crunch at this point, as the former have access to mortgages and consumer credit while the latter have access to bond and equity markets.
But non-prime borrowers – about one-third of US households – do not have much access to mortgages and credit cards.
They live from paycheck to paycheck – often a shrinking paycheck, owing to the decline in hourly wages and hours worked.
And the credit crunch for non-investment-grade firms and smaller firms, which rely mostly on access to bank loans rather than capital markets, is still severe.
Or consider bankruptcies and defaults by households and firms.
Larger firms – even those with large debt problems – can refinance their excessive liabilities in court or out of court; but an unprecedented number of small businesses are going bankrupt.
The same holds for households, with millions of weaker and poorer borrowers defaulting on mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, student loans, and other forms of consumer credit.
Consider also what is happening to private consumption and retail sales.
Recent monthly figures suggest a pick-up in retail sales.
But, because the official statistics capture mostly sales by larger retailers and exclude the fall in sales by hundreds of thousands of smaller stores and businesses that have failed, consumption looks better than it really is.
And, while higher-income and wealthier households have a buffer of savings to smooth consumption and avoid having to increase savings, most lower-income households must save more, as banks and other lenders cut back on home-equity loans and lower limits on credit cards.
As a result, the household savings rate has risen from zero to 4% of disposable income.
But it must rise further, to 8%, in order to reduce the high leverage of household sector.
To be sure, the US government is increasing its budget deficits to put a floor under demand.
But most state and local governments that have experienced a collapse in tax revenues must sharply retrench spending by firing policemen, teachers, and firefighters while also cutting welfare benefits and social services for the poor.
Many state and local governments in poorer regions of the country are at risk of bankruptcy unless the federal government undertakes a massive bailout of their finances.
Moreover, income and wealth inequality is rising again: poorer households are at greater risk of unemployment, falling wages, or reductions in hours worked, all leading to lower labor income, whereas on Wall Street outrageous bonuses have returned with a vengeance.
With the stock market rising while home prices are still falling, the wealthy are becoming richer, while the middle class and the poor – whose main wealth is a home rather than equities – are becoming poorer and being saddled with an unsustainable debt burden.
So, while the US may technically be close to the end of a severe recession, most of America is facing a near-depression.
Little wonder, then, that few Americans believe that what walks like a duck and quacks like a duck is actually the phoenix of recovery.
A Tale of Two Currency Areas
PALO ALTO – The United States and Europe are two giant free-trade areas, each wealthy but with serious short-run problems and immense long-run challenges.
They are also two single-currency areas: the dollar and, for much of Europe, the euro.
The challenges facing both are monumental.
But only Europe’s currency union faces uncertainty about its future; America faces no existential crisis for its currency.
The two economic powers’ similarities and differences, particularly with respect to internal labor mobility, productivity, and fiscal policies, suggest why – and provide clues about whether the eurozone can weather the crises on its periphery and evolve into a stable single-currency area.
Labor mobility from poorer to richer areas provides a shock absorber against differential economic hardship.
The other natural shock absorber is a depreciating currency, which increases competitiveness in the area hit hardest.
That cannot happen with a common currency, and economic adjustment is doubly difficult when labor is not mobile enough to help mitigate regional contractions in income and unemployment.
The reasons for lower labor mobility in the eurozone than in America are legion.
True, America’s original thirteen colonies were a loose federation, and many Americans considered themselves citizens of their state first and of the US second as late as a century after the Revolution.
But one’s state was not a fully formed nation, with its own shared and deeply ingrained history, culture, ethnic identity, and religion.
Perhaps the most important cultural component of labor mobility is language.
From Mississippi to Maine, and from New York to New Orleans, America’s written language is the same and the spoken language is understandable to all.
Not so from Berlin to Barcelona or Rome to Rotterdam.
(Or, for that matter, from northern to southern China or in multilingual India, where Hindi is spoken by only 42% of the population.)
For eurozone citizens who do not speak a major language, especially English, mobility across national borders within the single-currency area is limited at best.
These are differences that cannot be easily erased.
While some aspects of culture are becoming globalized, variation across borders in Europe is far greater than it is between US states.
For example, until the second half of the twentieth century, today’s eurozone members regularly slaughtered each other on centuries of battlefields.
By contrast, history is more commonly shared among Americans from different states, who, other than in the Civil War, have fought side by side in the nation’s external wars.
All of this means that when California slumps, residents simply leave for the mountain states; when manufacturing jobs disappear in the upper Midwest, people migrate to new jobs in Texas.
That pattern is much less prevalent in Europe.
Moreover, it is a pattern that has closed the gap (now roughly 40%) between per capita income in America’s poorest and richest states, as labor and capital continually adjust by moving to areas where productivity is higher.
The range of productivity and per capita income within the eurozone is considerably wider, making mobility even more important.
Finally, while fiscal systems differ among American states, the overall fiscal burden is under half that of the federal level.
Almost all states’ constitutions require balanced budgets (with exceptions for emergencies).
American states and municipalities do face serious medium- and long-term fiscal challenges from underfunded pension and health-care systems, but citizens living in different states have a common national budget, whereas citizens of different eurozone countries face radically different central-government fiscal positions.   
Indeed, many observers argue that the eurozone’s lack of a common fiscal system is its main problem.
But competition over taxes and services is beneficial, not harmful.
Nevertheless, much tighter constraints, with serious and enforceable penalties, must be placed on permissible budget positions and their transparency if the euro is to survive.
And it can survive.
Those who would write off the euro as a failure should consider that it is only ten years old.
America, too, historically had problems as a single-currency area, from early chaos before the Constitution to the clash between agricultural and banking interests over the gold standard in the late nineteenth century.
While the euro faces strong headwinds, the dollar’s early sailing wasn’t always smooth, either.
The eurozone countries must first deal with the sovereign-debt crisis, reduce their fiscal deficits, and strengthen the woefully undercapitalized banking system.
But, if the eurozone is to survive and prosper beyond the current crisis, it will also need comprehensive structural reforms to boost internal labor mobility and defuse the pressures caused by economic adjustment among nations and regions.
Whether citizens will support politicians who propose the labor, tax, and other reforms needed to enhance mobility, and whether such reforms will be sufficient to overcome linguistic and cultural barriers, are open questions.
Successive generations of post-war European political leaders initiated the European Union and then currency union in order to knit countries so closely together that another major war between them would become impossible.
Whether monetary union was necessary to accomplish that aim is debatable.
Despite the considerable advantages of a common currency (price transparency, lower transaction costs, and inflation credibility, to name a few), the difficulty of macroeconomic management of such diverse economies looms larger than ever.
The euro was always a big gamble, a grand experiment.
Historical efforts at monetary union have sometimes collapsed, and sometimes they have survived multiple crises.
The future of the eurozone may be cloudy, but it will not be dull.
A Tale of Two Terminals
BEIJING – Ever since it opened recently, Terminal 5 of London’s Heathrow Airport has been plagued with failures.
On the other side of the globe, Terminal 3 in Beijing, which opened for full operations just one day before Terminal 5, has been operating almost without a glitch.
The media, unsurprisingly, have feasted upon the failures of T5 in London, while neglecting the successes of T3 in Beijing.
By all measures, Beijing’s T3 surpasses London’s T5.
Whereas T5 can handle only 12,000 bags an hour (when it handles them at all) and 30 million passengers per year, T3 can handle 20,000 bags an hour and 50 million passengers.
While T5 will mostly service British Airways, T3 will service Air China and two dozen other airlines. 
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });At one million square meters, T3 in Beijing is the largest terminal in the world, but was much less costly to build than T5 in London.
Using the most recent exchange rates, T3 cost only $3.86 billion compared with $8.6 billion for London’s T5.
Furthermore, T3 took less than four years to complete, whereas T5 took almost 20 years.
But to call T3 a success for socialism and T5 a failure of capitalism would be to miss a fundamental point.
After all, if China’s political system can still be called socialism, it is at best “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which embodies an increasing amount of market-oriented economic activity and greater economic openness and transparency.
It would be similarly misleading to attribute T3’s success to China alone.
After all, T3 was designed by a Briton, and has incorporated the most recent architectural and operational trends, styles, and standards in the world.
T3 in Beijing is just one of many projects China has recently built to improve its transportation infrastructure.
In addition to having become the world’s industrial park, China now has more mobile phone subscribers than the combined populations of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the number of Internet users has just surpassed that in the US. 
All of this development raises a fundamental question: how should we make sense of the explosive productivity growth that has become China’s new hallmark?
Those who cling to old ideological stereotypes face an almost impossible task in reconciling China’s rapid growth with what they condemn as China’s failing system. 
The truth is that ever since the end of the 1970’s, China has become convinced that peace and stability are the most important preconditions for its development.
Thus, anything that may distract China from its focus on peace, stability, and development has been strongly resisted.
This may help explain why T3 in Beijing is such a success, and why Chinese are now more united than ever before in condemning attempts to hijack or sully the Olympics for ulterior motives.
I hope that when millions of overseas passengers pass through T3, including those who do so during the Beijing Olympics, they will pause and reflect upon the distance China has traveled over the past three decades in its reform and opening to the outside world.  Granted, China still has further to go, and many people may find fault with much in the country.
But they should not refuse to acknowledge that China’s mission to turn a nation of 1.3 billion poor people into a developed country through peace and free trade is one of the great, honorable, and most difficult sagas in human history.
Following the disturbances in Tibet and the troubles affecting the Olympic torch’s progress around the world, some voices abroad are showing a greater inclination to dismiss, vilify, humiliate, or even split China.
But it would be best for all to pause a moment, contemplate T3 in Beijing, consider what it represents, and reflect on what an accomplishment the quick completion of such an iconic structure is for an emerging country like China.
A Thai Spring?
BANGKOK – The thunderous results of Thailand’s general election on July 3 will seem familiar to anyone attuned to the political upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa.
Entrenched incumbent regimes everywhere are under severe stress from advances in information technology, shifts in demographics, rising expectations, and the obsolescence of Cold War exigencies.
In the absence of a willingness and ability to use violent repression, regime survival can be achieved only through concessions, accommodation, and periodic reinvention.
With 47 million voters and turnout at 75%, Thailand’s latest election results pose a decisive challenge to the country’s long-established regime.
The Pheu Thai party, led by Yingluck Shinawatra, the youngest sister of exiled fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, secured a resounding triumph, winning 265 seats in the 500-member assembly, while the ruling Democrat Party mustered just 159.
The return to power of Pheu Thai is extraordinary – and not only because Yingluck will be Thailand’s first female prime minister.
The establishment-aligned courts dissolved the party’s two previous governments, and banned scores of its leading politicians from office for five years.
Pheu Thai’s victory thus suggests that a previously marginalized electorate has been permanently awakened.
A similar majority of the Thai electorate voted for Thaksin’s parties and their pro-poor populist platforms in January 2001, February 2005, April 2006, and December 2007, defying a military coup, a coup-induced constitution, judicial interventions, and army coercion and repression.
The recent election marked a profound break from the past.
In the second half of the twentieth century, Thai elections seemed to alternate with military coups.
Voters were bought and sold like commodities.
After elections, voters hardly ever saw or heard from their MPs, who typically went on to engage in corruption and graft in Bangkok – eventually losing legitimacy and paving the way for military coups.
A new constitution and elections invariably ensued.
This vicious cycle of coups, constitutions, and elections defined Thai politics for decades.
That pattern reflected Cold War imperatives.
The pillars of the Thai state – nation, religion, and the king – struck a unifying, collective chord, and the resulting stability enabled economic development.
While growth was so concentrated that popular resentment simmered, communism was kept at bay.
Challenges to the established order, with the military-monarchy-bureaucracy triumvirate as its anchor, were repeatedly put down.
Back then, Thai schoolchildren sang martial songs each morning, and Thais knew their place in the rigidly elitist pecking order, which was reinforced by socialization and indoctrination in classrooms and living rooms, where only state-controlled media could enter.
Thais were more like obedient subjects than informed citizens.
Dissenting views found little traction.
The rise of Thaksin’s Thai Rak Thai party in 2001 changed all that.
The party pursued a scientific approach to elections, relied on expensive polling by foreign experts, and offered a clear agenda and strong leadership.
It was the first post-Cold War party to capture Thais’ collective imagination.
The voices of neglected swaths of the electorate, particularly in the rural north and northeast of the country, began to count.
Vote-buying became increasingly insufficient.
A bond between party and voters – a bond based on policy – took root.
By 2001, the Cold War was long over.
Political leaders who dissented from the status quo could no longer easily be jailed on communism-related charges.
The advent of the Internet had made it harder for the authorities to shape Thai minds, as media sources multiplied and the resulting diffusion of information undermined the effectiveness of state propaganda.
Moreover, new international norms had come to the fore: external powers that previously turned a blind eye to coups, military dictatorships, and repression now rallied around democracy and human rights.
Thailand’s demographics also changed.
The Cold War curriculum of induced unity and stability has no relevance for today’s schoolchildren; indeed, most university students nowadays were born after the Cold War ended.
These factors fostered a new political environment, and Thaksin, who was a telecommunications tycoon at the time, was well positioned to seize the opportunity.
He overhauled the bureaucracy, delivered on his promises to the poor, mapped out an industrial strategy, and re-designed an overstretched foreign policy agenda, among other innovative measures.
Of course, Thaksin’s rule had a dark underside: corruption, legislated conflicts of interest, cronyism, human rights violations, and abuse of power, among other evidence of misrule.
Such is Thaksin’s mixed legacy.
The opportunities, hopes, and dreams delivered to the downtrodden and the vision and plans for Thailand’s future were enmeshed with his own venality.
But, while Thaksin committed many infractions, his gravest “sin” was to have changed the way Thais think and behave.
Some see this change as usurpation; others view it as Thailand’s deliverance into the twenty-first century.
Thaksin’s adversaries in Thailand’s entrenched regime were unwilling to accede to his policy innovations and populism.
For them, doing so would be tantamount to admitting that most people in this hospitable, well-endowed kingdom had been kept poor by design all along.
For his part, Thaksin has sought to portray the recent election results as being all about him.
But he is best viewed as a self-serving, unwitting agent of political modernization.
It is these twenty-first-century dynamics and changes, underpinned by an increasingly assertive citizenry, with which the Thai establishment must come to terms if the country is to move forward.
A Thousand to One
HAIFA – The celebrations in Israel over the release of the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit come after the Israeli government concluded that diplomatic rarity, an agreement with Hamas.
It is as if the government had brought back an Israeli who had been sent to Mars.

Of course, other Israeli soldiers and civilians have been held captive in Arab states or abducted by terrorist organizations and other militant groups over the years.&#160;And Israel has been willing in the past to barter hundreds or thousands of detainees in exchange for the release of just a few of its citizens.&#160;But, for as long as I can remember, popular enthusiasm has never been so overwhelmingly supportive of such a deal as it is now, with the joy virtually exploding across the country after the news of Shalit’s pending release began to circulate.
One reason for this outpouring of enthusiasm is clear: the Shalit family’s remarkable ability to keep alive interest in his cause throughout the five years since his abduction.
Indeed, the Israeli public consistently supported the idea of the government reaching agreement with Hamas for the soldier’s release.
Many Israelis, from all social classes, joined the campaign for Shalit’s release.
Demonstrations and meetings were organized.&#160;Posters were hung everywhere to remember the number of days of his ordeal.&#160;But the Shalit family is given the most credit: they left their home in a small village in Galilee to camp out for more than a year near the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem, reminding the Israeli public of the victim’s suffering and pushing the government to accept Hamas’s conditions.
But, despite deep popular sympathy, not a few Israelis – on both the left and the right – opposed the exchange of one soldier for a thousand or more Palestinian prisoners, some of whom perpetrated terrorist attacks that killed dozens of people.
Some consider the Palestinian prisoners’ release a mistake, legally and ethically, and a shocking injustice to the families of their victims.
Others, more numerous, deplore the disparity in numbers in the swap.
Unlike the first group, they would be ready to accept the release of one Palestinian prisoner – even if he were responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack – but not a thousand of them.
But there is another way to look at the disparity.
Israel achieved remarkable results in the wars fought against far more populous Arab countries in 1948, 1967, and 1973.
Its soldiers are well trained and rely on advanced technologies and military abilities that are superior to those of the Arab countries – and far better than those of Palestinian militant groups.
By demanding the release of more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for one soldier, Hamas is conceding the stark military reality of this imbalance: thousands of their prisoners, fighting with knives, explosive belts, and primitive rockets, are worth only one Israeli soldier.
Israel is, of course, resigned to its numerical inferiority, and will continue to train its soldiers in order to overcome this deficit.&#160;As a result, one prisoner in exchange for a thousand Palestinian prisoners is neither a humiliation nor a surrender, but an acceptable agreement that acknowledges, even on behalf of the enemy, the military capacity of Israeli soldiers.
There are also those who vigorously oppose the prisoner exchange with Hamas because some of the released prisoners will return to terrorism against Israel, as has happened after past exchanges.&#160;The release of one Israeli soldier in exchange for such men could therefore endanger many lives in the future.
But many of the released prisoners will be transferred to the Gaza Strip, a territory that is completely separate from Israel, where they might join Hamas’s militant forces but will not be able to execute terrorist attacks against Israel.
Likewise, other prisoners will be expelled to the West Bank, and will not come into contact with the Israeli population, neither in the settlements nor in Israel.
Indeed, those remaining in the West Bank will be under the supervision not only of Israeli security forces – who know everything they need to know – but also of the Palestinian Authority.&#160;In recent years, the Palestinian Authority has effectively prevented acts of terrorism and violence against Israelis, with the aim of stabilizing the situation in the West Bank in order to prepare for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
The 70 or so prisoners who will return to the West Bank could also be influenced by the positive atmosphere created by the Palestinian Authority as it awaits the resumption of negotiations to achieve a two-state (and two-population) solution.
Finally, a gleam of hope might arise from necessity.
Perhaps – just perhaps – one or even two of the released Palestinians will be willing to cooperate – and to lead others into cooperating – with an enemy that had been their jailer.
From South Africa to Burma, there are clear and positive precedents for such a turn of events.
A Time to Build
Any good international investment banker knows that the end of April is a bad time to come peddling his services, for that is when the world’s finance ministers return home from the IMF meetings in Washington, chastened that risks to the global economy could spill over into their own backyards.
Ministers are too busy recovering from their trauma to think about paying fat fees for big new international bond issues.
Who wants to build up debt if there might be a financial crisis around the corner?
Better to keep socking away US Treasury bills, even if the return is far lower than on most other investments.
Or is it?
With today’s global economy in the middle of a sustained and increasingly balanced expansion, has the time come to start considering upside risks?
In particular, should governments, especially those that are endlessly building up dollar reserves, instead start thinking about how to build up their roads, bridges, ports, electric grids, and other infrastructure?
Has the time come to start laying the groundwork to sustain future growth, especially in poorer regions that have not yet shared in today’s prosperity?
Don’t get me wrong, I am not arguing for fiscal profligacy.
But the balance of risks has shifted over the past few years.
Yes, within the next three to five years, there will probably be another global recession.
And, yes, there will probably be another rash of financial crises – perhaps in Central Europe, which now looks like Asia did before its 1997 crisis.
Recent jitters about Iceland’s gaping trade deficit and Brazil’s new finance minister rippled around the world, reminding global investors that while many emerging markets are gradually moving towards investment-grade status, most are not there yet.
But the risks are two-sided, and sound economic policy is just as much about capitalizing on good times as avoiding bad ones.
Economic gurus at places like the World Bank have developed a ridiculously long list of steps that countries should take to raise their growth rates (the so-called “extended Washington Consensus”).
Like maintaining good health, it is not enough to concentrate on a single component.
But if there is one area where obvious opportunities exist, and where policy can really make a difference, it would have to be infrastructure investment.
India’s infrastructure problems are legendary, with airports and railroads that are comically inadequate.
However, aside from a few countries – including China, of course, but also Spain – low infrastructure spending is epidemic.
Even the United States has infrastructure that is hobbled by neglect, with collapsing bridges and a dangerously overburdened electrical grid.
Land-rich Brazil, too, is a case study in the consequences of under-investment.
Its infrastructure systems might be adequate to support the country’s tepid 3-4% growth rates, but they are hardly adequate to support the 6-7% rates that it ought to be enjoying amidst the current global boom.
Russia, despite Siberia’s massive oil and gas riches, isn’t even investing enough to support healthy growth in its energy industries, much less human development in the country’s impoverished areas (including hapless Siberia).
True, government infrastructure spending is often wasted.
My hometown of Boston recently managed to spend an astounding $15 billion dollars to move a few highways underground.
And that so-called “Big Dig” looks like a model of efficiency next to many of Japan’s infamous bridges to nowhere.
But there are ways to waste less.
Transparency in procurement works wonders.
So, too, does private sector involvement.
The Nobel laureate economist William Vickrey argued tirelessly in favor of privately financed toll roads.
Private oversight can often produce better and more efficient construction, and, in theory, toll roads help alleviate traffic congestion. (Ironically, Vickery died while sitting in a traffic jam.)
Even China, which has added more than 50,000 kilometers of roads and dozens of airports over the past five years, makes use of private financing.
True, countries that have not cleaned up their fiscal act, such as India, must not recklessly plunge ahead with big government projects without counterbalancing reforms to ensure sustainability.
Fiscal prudence and stable inflation rates are cornerstones of today’s relatively healthy global economic environment.
But for countries that have scope to invest more, particularly those that are holding a surfeit of precious development dollars in idle US Treasury bills, the time may be ripe to reassess the balance of risks.
The IMF is absolutely right to remind ministers each April of downside risks.
Countries’ need for better infrastructure is no license to throw prudence out the window.
But when the world’s finance ministers recover from their April shock therapy, they also need to look at the opportunities.
A Time to Dare
NEW YORK – The upcoming G-20 meeting is a make-or-break event.
Unless it introduces practical measures to support the countries at the periphery of the global financial system, global markets will suffer another round of decline, just as they did after United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s failure in February to produce practical measures to recapitalize America’s banking system.
The current financial crisis is different from all the others we have experienced since World War II.
On previous occasions, whenever the financial system came to the brink of a breakdown, the authorities got their act together and pulled it back from the brink.
This time the system actually broke down in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse last September, and it had to be put on artificial life support.
Among other measures, both Europe and the US have effectively guaranteed that no other important financial institution will be allowed to fail.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });This step was necessary, but it produced unintended adverse consequences: many other countries, from Eastern Europe to Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, could not offer similarly convincing guarantees.
Abetted by the determination of national financial authorities at the center of the world economy to protect their own institutions, capital fled from the periphery.
Currencies fell, interest rates rose, and credit default swaps soared.
When the history of this crisis is written, it will be recorded that – in contrast to the Great Depression – protectionism first prevailed in finance rather than trade.
The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) are now faced with a novel task: to protect the periphery countries from a storm that emanated from the center.
They are used to dealing with governments; now they must learn to deal with the collapse of the private sector.
If they fail to do so, the periphery economies will suffer even more than those at the center.
Countries on the periphery tend to be poorer and more dependent on commodities than the more developed world, and they must repay more than $1.4 trillion in bank loans in 2009 alone.  These loans cannot be rolled over without international assistance.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown recognized the problem and placed it on the G-20’s agenda.
But, in the course of preparations, profound attitudinal differences have surfaced, particularly between the US and Germany. 
The US has recognized that only using the credit of the state to the fullest extent possible can reverse the collapse of credit in the private sector.
Germany, traumatized by the memory of hyperinflation in the 1920’s and the consequent rise of Hitler in the 1930’s, is reluctant to sow the seeds of future inflation by incurring too much debt.
Both positions are firmly held and can be buttressed by arguments that are valid from the point of view of the country concerned.
But the controversy threatens to disrupt the April 2 meeting.
It should be possible for each side to respect the other’s position without abandoning its ownand to find common ground.
Instead of setting a universal target of 2% of GDP for stimulus packages, it is enough to agree that the periphery countries need international assistance to protect their financial systems and engage in countercyclical policies.
That is in the common interest.
If the periphery economies are allowed to collapse, developed countries will also be hurt.
As things stand now, the G-20 meeting will produce some concrete results: the resources of the International Monetary Fund are likely to be effectively doubled, mainly by using the mechanism of the New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB), which can be activated without resolving the vexing question of reapportioning voting rights in the IFIs.
This will be sufficient to enable the IMF to come to the aid of specific countries in trouble, but it will not provide a systemic solution without conditionality.
Such a solution is readily available in the form of Special Drawing Rights (SDR).
The mechanism exists and has already been used on a small scale.
SDRs are highly complicated and difficult to grasp, but they boil down to the international creation of money.
Countries that are in a position to create their own money do not need them, but the periphery countries do.
Rich countries should therefore lend their allocations to the countries in need.
This would not create a budget deficit for rich countries.
Recipient countries would have to pay the IMF a very low interest rate: the composite average treasury bill rate of all convertible currencies.
They would have free use of their own allocations, but the IFIs would supervise how the borrowed allocations are used to ensure that the borrowed funds are well spent.
It is difficult to think of a scheme where the cost/benefit ratio is so favorable.
In addition to the one-time increase in the IMF’s resources, there ought to be substantial annual SDR issues, say, $250 billion, as long as the global recession lasts.
To make the scheme counter-cyclical, the SDR issues could be callable in tranches when the global economy overheats.
It is too late to agree on issuing SDRs at the upcoming G-20 meeting, but if it were proposed by President Barack Obama and endorsed in principle by the majority of participants, it would be sufficient to give heart to the markets and make the meeting a resounding success.
A Time to Experiment
CAMBRIDGE – The world economy enters 2009 with more uncertainty (and anxiety) than at any time in recent memory.
Although the financial crisis appears to be contained in the United States and Europe, its full repercussions will not be clear for some time.
The advanced countries are in for the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
But how long and deep will this recession be, and how badly will it affect emerging and developing nations?
We don’t have the answers to these questions, in part because the consequences will depend on what actions policymakers take.
The right responses will ensure that the world economy can begin to recover by late 2009. Poor policy choices, on the other hand, will at best delay recovery and at worst do permanent damage.
Here is a list of things to watch for.
Will the US response be “bold” enough?
Barack Obama has promised that it will be, echoing at least part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous call for “bold, persistent experimentation” at the height of the Great Depression in 1932.
Obama has a first-rate group of economists on his side, which ensures that he will not do anything silly.
But America’s circumstances are sufficiently exceptional that he will need advisers who are willing to try new, untested ideas – in other words, experimentation à la FDR.
In particular, he will need to go beyond Keynesian fiscal-stimulus policies to heal the deep wounds to economic confidence that lie at the root of the current crisis.
So far, confidence-building measures have been limited to financial markets, through public guarantees, liquidity support, and capital injections.
But workers who worry about being laid off are unlikely to go spend, regardless of how much money fiscal stimulus puts in their pockets.
Just as banks are hoarding cash, households will try to preserve wealth by increasing their saving.
So incentives targeted directly at preserving employment will have to be part of the solution.
Will Europe get its act together?
This could have been Europe’s moment.
After all, the crisis originated in the US and left American policy focused on its domestic troubles, opening up room for global leadership by others.
Instead, the crisis demonstrated the deep divisions within Europe – on everything from financial regulation to the requisite policy response.
Germany has dragged its feet on fiscal stimulus, stymieing what should have been the second leg of a globally coordinated fiscal action plan.
If Europe wants to pull its weight on the global stage, it will have to act with greater unity of purpose and shoulder a greater share of responsibility.
Alas, the best that can be hoped for at this stage is that Europe will not undermine the global fiscal stimulus that even the International Monetary Fund, the guardian of fiscal orthodoxy, regards as absolutely essential.
Will China hold together?
Even though a weak US response is the biggest risk on the economic side, what happens in China may well have deeper and more lasting consequences on the broader historical canvas.
For China is a country of enormous hidden tensions and cleavages, and these may erupt into open conflict in difficult economic times.
Experts on China differ on the rate of economic growth needed to create employment for the millions of Chinese who flock into the country’s cities every year.
But it is virtually certain that China will fall short of this threshold in 2009.
This explains the almost continuous stream of measures that emanate from Beijing these days: increased public spending, monetary easing, pressure on state enterprises to expand activity, subsidies to exporters, partial convertibility of the remninbi to spur trade with neighboring countries, and so on. But will this do enough to stem the slowdown in an economy that has become hooked on external demand in recent years?
If social tensions rise, China’s government is likely to respond with greater repression, which will bode ill both for its relations with the West and for its medium-term political stability.
Experience shows that democracies hold the edge over authoritarian regimes when it comes to handling the fallout from crises.
It was democratic India (in 1991) and South Korea (in 1997-1998) that turned around their economies quickly, while Pinochet’s Chile (in 1983) and Suharto’s Indonesia (in 1997-98) fell into deeper quagmires.
Authoritarian regimes lack the institutions of conflict management that democracies provide.
So tensions spill over into the streets and take the form of riots and protests.
However the Chinese leadership responds, future generations may remember 2009 less for its global economic and financial crisis than for the momentous transformation that it caused in China.
Will there be enough global economic cooperation?
When domestic needs become paramount, global economic cooperation suffers.
But the costs of protectionism in trade and finance are especially large at moments like these.
The Great Depression was aggravated by the trade barriers that countries imposed to protect domestic employment.
This will be a temptation this time around as well.
And banks – whether explicitly nationalized or not – will be under pressure to prioritize domestic borrowers.
So far, the IMF has reacted with newfound vigor, establishing a much-needed short-term lending facility, which may well need to be expanded if emerging markets come under greater pressure.
The World Trade Organization, meanwhile, has wasted valuable time on the irrelevant Doha round.
It should have focused its efforts on monitoring and implementing the G-20’s commitment not to raise trade barriers.
Policymakers need to shed received wisdom and forget useless dichotomies such as “markets versus government” or “nation-state versus globalization.”
They need to come to grips with the reality that national regulations and international markets are inextricably linked with – and in need of – each other.
The more pragmatically and creatively they act, the more quickly the world economy will recover.
A Time to Spend
BERKELEY – The central insight of macroeconomics is a fact that was known to John Stuart Mill in the first third of the nineteenth century: there can be a large gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess demand for financial assets.
And this fundamental fact is a source of big trouble.
A normal gap between supply and demand for some subset of currently produced commodities is not a serious problem, because it is balanced by excess demand for other currently produced commodities.
As industries suffering from insufficient demand shed workers, industries benefiting from surplus demand hire them.
The economy rapidly rebalances itself and thus returns to full employment – and does so with a configuration of employment and production that is better adapted to current consumer preferences.
By contrast, a gap between supply and demand when the corresponding excess demand is for financial assets is a recipe for economic meltdown.
There is, after all, no easy way that unemployed workers can start producing the assets – money and bonds that not only are rated investment-grade, but really are – that financial markets are not adequately supplying.
The flow of workers out of employment exceeds the flow back into employment.
And, as employment and incomes drop, spending on currently produced commodities drops further, and the economy spirals down into depression.
Thus, the first principle of macroeconomic policy is that because only the government can create the investment-grade financial assets that are in short supply in a depression, it is the government’s task to do so.
The government must ensure that the money supply matches the full-employment level of money demand, and that the supply of safe savings vehicles in which investors can park their wealth also meets demand.
How well have the world’s governments performed this task over the past three years?
In East Asia (minus Japan), governments appear to have been doing rather well.
Shortage of demand for currently produced goods and services and mass unemployment no longer loom as the region’s biggest macroeconomic problems.
Flooding their economies with liquidity, maintaining export-friendly exchange rates, and spending to employ workers directly and boost the supply of safe savings vehicles have made the Great Recession in East Asia less dire than it has been elsewhere.
In North America, governments appear to have muddled through.
They have not provided enough bank guarantees, forced enough mortgage renegotiations, increased spending enough, or financed enough employment to rebalance financial markets, return asset prices to normal configurations, and facilitate a rapid return to full employment.
But unemployment has not climbed far above 10%, either.
The most serious problems right now are in Europe.
Uncertainty about how, exactly, the liabilities of highly leveraged banks and over-leveraged peripheral governments are to be guaranteed is shrinking the supply of safe savings vehicles at a time when macroeconomic rebalancing calls for it to be rising.
And the rapid reductions in budget deficits that European governments are now pledged to undertake can only increase the likelihood of a full double-dip recession.
The broad pattern is clear: the more that governments have worried about enabling future moral hazard by excessive bailouts and sought to stem the rise in public debt, the worse their countries’ economies have performed.
The more that they have focused on policies to put people back to work in the short run, the better their economies have done.
This pattern would not have surprised nineteenth-century economists like Mill or Walter Bagehot, who understood the financial-sector origins of industrial depression.
But it does seem to surprise not only a great many observers today, but also a large number of policymakers.
A Tribute to Evil
In May, the world will mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
But instead of happily preparing for that occasion, the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – which scarcely 15 years ago regained the independence they lost in WWII – are uneasy.
The heads of state of all three countries have been invited to participate in the parades to be held in Moscow to celebrate the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany.
But the host of the celebration, Russia, in the guise of the Soviet Union, itself caused the war – the bloodiest in European history – whose end is being commemorated.
Of course, the USSR instigated the war in tandem with Adolf Hitler, but its responsibility is undeniable.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });By holding these celebrations in Red Square, and thus highlighting the Soviet victory, today’s Russia is also celebrating its gains in that war.
One of those gains was my country, Lithuania, whose incorporation into Stalin’s empire was accompanied by countless tragedies.
Unlike Germany, Russia has never recognized its responsibility for the war and the mass graves of the innocent.
Thus, a former captive nation is now being invited to celebrate its captivity.
This is why almost all Lithuanians – indeed, most residents of the Baltic countries – feel queasy at the prospect of their leaders marking this anniversary in Moscow.
But Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians are not the only Europeans who should feel this way.
When Stalin offered Hitler his friendship in the spring of 1939 – formally concluded that summer in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact – Nazi aggression was assured of not being knifed in the back from the East and so was left with free hands to do as Hitler pleased in the West.
The Pact came after the pogroms of “Kristallnacht” in Germany, so its Soviet initiators knew pretty well to what destiny they were consigning the Jews of Poland and Lithuania, which, in accord with the first secret Protocol signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov on August 23, 1939, were to go to Hitler.
A month later, in equal secrecy, Hitler sold Lithuania to Stalin.
The other countries situated between Germany and the USSR were similarly sentenced to disappear as nations – sooner or later.
Their peoples were treated practically as though they did not exist; the aggressors’ only concern was territory.
The death sentences and torturing that were then imposed on almost entire nations and millions of people are, it now appears, to be silently accepted and noisily celebrated on May 9 in Moscow.
Some Russian officials want to unveil a monument Stalin to crown the festivities.
When Hitler’s Wehrmacht struck West, the USSR duly supported Germany in its war against Poland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom.
As a result, cities in those countries were flattened and people killed not only by the Nazis, but also by their Soviet ally, which invaded Poland and supplied the Wehrmacht with the material it needed for its war against the West.
In return, Stalin’s USSR was given a free hand to attack Finland and to occupy Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as a part of Romania.
In law, when two criminals seal a contract with the blood of their victims, that act remains a crime, even if the two criminals later have a falling out and spray bullets at one another.
The same applies to the two greatest European criminals of the twentieth century.
We must not forget the crimes that Hitler and Stalin committed together as de facto allies only because they later turned on each other.
The blood of WWII’s victims calls for justice and fairness, but most of all it demands honesty about who and what caused their tragic fate.
If those who gather in Moscow on May 9 do anything to validate Soviet war crimes, they will show themselves insensitive to the silent cries of WWII’s tens of millions of dead innocents.
The only real winner would be the spirit of that evil.
A Tribute to James Wolfensohn
Over the past decade, the global economy has achieved unprecedented prosperity built on trade, international capital flows, and technological innovation.
Amidst this undeniable progress, however, remain widespread poverty, disease, and illiteracy.
In a world made smaller by modern telecommunications, satellite TV, and the Internet, the vast challenges of development that we continue to face confront us everyday.
Perhaps no individual has done more to raise the alarm – earning deserved credit for many successes and understanding all too clearly the remaining shortcomings – than James Wolfensohn, the outgoing President of the World Bank.
As Managing Director of the IMF, I have had the privilege of working closely with Jim Wolfensohn, seeing up close a man with an extraordinary mission: the sustainable reduction of global poverty.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Wolfensohn left a successful business career to lead the global campaign against poverty.
It is perhaps the ultimate tribute to his commitment and tenacity that his efforts over the past 10 years have attracted criticism as well as praise, for he has stood at the center of every major campaign aimed at alleviating the economic ills of our generation.
Wolfensohn led the World Bank onto the cutting edge of every important development debate, and was at the forefront of the effort to combat HIV/AIDS, as well as other deadly diseases that threaten so many impoverished countries.
He has been a forthright spokesman for women’s rights and a champion of environmental concerns, as well as a formidable advocate in arguing for debt reduction for the most heavily indebted nations.
He also has placed the World Bank at the center of the effort to help rebuild nations emerging from devastating civil conflict, from Bosnia to Sierra Leone to East Timor.
As World Bank president, Wolfensohn argued consistently that the world cannot be divided into “haves” and “have-nots.”
Poverty anywhere means poverty everywhere, and equitable growth is needed for the stability and security of all.
Indeed, that is the true meaning of globalization.
At the same time, Wolfensohn made a big contribution to development work by arguing that poverty must be treated as a multidimensional problem.
It is now widely accepted that financial assistance alone will not bring about effective poverty reduction.
Rather, sustainable, pro-poor growth is the key, requiring political stability – that is, peace and security for individuals – good governance, and ownership of policies by all stakeholders.
Under Wolfensohn, the World Bank followed through on this comprehensive and coordinated approach in a concrete fashion, making significant inroads into global poverty.
In the last 10 years, the Bank was the largest external financier of primary education, basic health care, HIV/AIDS programs, and programs aimed at protecting the environment and biodiversity.
This agenda goes to the heart of improving human dignity and maintaining sustainable development.
Wolfensohn’s insistence that corruption be confronted as part of the development process was another valuable step forward.
It used to be that even mentioning corruption in some official circles was considered taboo.
But corruption poses the single largest obstacle to growth and development in many countries, especially as it diverts resources from the poor.
The World Bank insisted that corruption be seen as a cancer, and that fighting it be made synonymous with fighting poverty.
Indeed, outspokenness was a hallmark of Wolfensohn’s tenure.
Many a government minister, Bank officer and NGO representative has experienced his blunt criticism, as well as his effusive praise.
The IMF has not been immune to this treatment.
The strength of the Bretton Woods institutions lies in intellectual diversity, and the Fund benefited from Wolfensohn’s honesty, as well as from his commitment to Bank-Fund cooperation, which progressively deepened during the past decade.
The work of our two institutions — in areas as diverse as poverty reduction strategies, debt relief, and the unheralded joint program to analyze financial sectors in our member countries — strengthened the global economy.
Ultimately, development is about people.
Jim Wolfensohn’s greatest strength has been his genuine caring for the world’s poor.
His legacy will include a World Bank that is firmly committed to a world free of poverty.
The poor around the world may feel poorer from losing him as their champion and advocate.
In fact, their prospects are brighter because of his work over the past decade.
A Tricky Trade Treaty
When is a free-trade agreement bad?
When the treaty's underlying purpose is neither about trade nor freedom.
Such a pact - calling for a "united economic space" - is now being entered into by Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.
On the surface, a "united economic space" sounds like something to applaud.
But, sadly, the treaty will only entrench postcommunism's corrupt and criminal business practices, not increase trade or prosperity.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });A huge benefit for the accession countries in preparing themselves to join the EU was that they were forced to conform to European business, political, and legal norms.
The proposed "united economic space" will also have its own norms - the ways of the oligarch, the corrupt bureaucrat, the crony capitalist, and the politically motivated prosecutor.
Does anyone doubt that the jailing of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chairman of Yukos oil, is politically motivated?
I myself have endured numerous politically inspired investigations and prosecutions of my former business as a means to drive me out of politics.
Can anyone imagine such a prosecution occurring in the EU?
That Mr. Khodorkovsky is spending months in jail before he is formally charged tells us much about the nature of business, politics, and law in the nations of the former Soviet Union.
In the countries of the "united economic space," the rule of law typically means, "I rule, and I am the law."
So, instead of promoting growth, the "united economic space" will retard it by discouraging competition and investment.
Instead of enhancing European stability, it will undermine it by dividing Europe into the EU's single market and an economic trading area ruled by arbitrary fiat and decree.
But, as a matter of economic principle, practical diplomacy, and visionary politics, aren't regional free-trade areas at least a step in the right direction?
After all, countries that scrap tariffs among themselves trade more and often raise their economic grow rates as a result.
Moreover, free-trade agreements are typically seen as politically valuable: countries tied by commerce are supposedly less likely to shoot at each other.
Unfortunately, the "united economic space" promises no such benefits.
By definition, it discriminates against countries outside the club, with which trade will not be liberalized.
Members will specialize in industries in which they lack comparative advantage, undercutting the main reason to support free trade in the first place.
Worse yet, markets will be carved up for political, not commercial, reasons, locking in inefficiencies.
The "political" argument - that regional trade bodies promote peaceful foreign relations - is simply wrongheaded in the post-Soviet case.
After all, Ukraine managed to eliminate its nuclear weapons and reach accommodation over the Black Sea fleet without joining a private economic bloc with Russia.
On the other hand, not long after the "united economic space" was announced, Russia began to cast covetous eyes on the Ukrainian Black Sea island of Tuszla.
Economic borders cannot and will not disappear until Russia and Ukraine agree on their territorial borders.
Because the proposed members of this new "united economic space" share Russian as alingua franca and a common past within the USSR, outsiders may dismiss too readily subtler differences in culture, outlook, and even vocabulary.
Because the region shares many outward forms of European culture, it is a short step to assuming that recent moves to free-markets and democracy will be seamless and permanent.
But the "united economic space" is also a perversion because the presence of Belarus and Kazakstan will ensure that democracy remains low on the agenda.
Another perversion of democracy is the fact that the supra-national body that is to administer the "united economic space" grants Ukraine and its 49 million people only 9.9% of votes, while it gives Russia and its 140 million people 83%.
That gross imbalance in representation is a shameful betrayal of Ukraine's sovereignty.
It is a deal that can only have been agreed to as the price of Russian support for Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma as he desperately seeks to extend his presidency beyond the two-term limit that he faces this year.
My opposition to the "united economic space" is not opposition to Russia.
The more Ukraine trades abroad, the better; if more of that open trade goes Russia's way, so be it.
But that trade should reflect Ukraine's competing with the world, unconstrained by a private deal that excludes outsiders and their demands for a stable and predictable legal environment and the best business practices.
I am not one of those people who think Russia is so naturally collectivist that free trade and an open economy cannot work there.
Nor do I believe that Russia is so inherently autocratic that democracy must invariably fail.
But I do believe that, for these canards to be discarded, Russia and Ukraine must open themselves to global competition, not isolate themselves with each other.
Dmitri Likhachev, one of Russia's most respected intellectuals in the communist era, said that there is no such thing as the Russian soul; "we can create whatever future we want."
Ukraine and Russia, too, can create the future they want, but not by closing themselves off in a "united economic space" that, in reality, is nothing more than another dark corner.
A Triumph for “Old Europe”
Italy may have defeated France to win the World Cup, but the real winner was the “Old Europe” that Donald Rumsfeld once derided.
After all, who would have predicted a World Cup final between France and Italy?
It looks as if the national teams of the two “sick men of Europe,” felt obliged to change their countries’ images in the world.
In the Italian case, following the corruption scandals that have nearly sunk Il Calcio, Italy’s premier football league, the national team had to rehabilitate the game in the eyes of their fellow citizens.
More globally, however, it is as if “Old Europe” had decided that it was time to set the record straight and prove more dynamic than the world’s emerging forces.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Indeed, in the new global balance, where football has become much more than sport, Europe is back with a vengeance.
What has been unfolding in front of our eyes in the last four weeks has been a modern and reduced version of the balance-of-power system that dominated Europe and the world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
If football and its culminating moment, the World Cup, has become the universal religion of the global age, this is above all because it fulfills, in a non-spiritual way, contradictory instincts in human nature.
Football magnifies the cult of the individual and the glorification of the hero, but it is also a celebration of the cooperative team spirit.
More than any other collective activity, it channels the search for identity and identification that dominates our age.
Thanks to the World Cup, one is a citizen of the world, enjoying a spectacle together with billions of others on “Planet Soccer.”
Even in Washington, where I arrived at the beginning of the tournament, I was greeted at the airport by television screens showing the game.
The program was in English, but the advertisements were in Spanish. In terms of football at least, the Hispanic community’s influence has brought the United States closer to Europe (though not, of course, in its team’s performance on the pitch).
At the same time, during the World Cup, fans are not only universal; they are also unique, and they can express their difference with impunity, sometimes in the most assertive, aggressive, and, unfortunately, occasionally racist manner.
In a world of “multiple identities,” to choose one’s team is in part to decide who one is.
From this standpoint, this year’s World Cup has not only witnessed the triumph of European nations – all semi-finalists were European for the first time since 1982 – but also the absence of even a glimmer of European emotions.
In my country, France, most supporters were clearly motivated more by post-colonial references than by European allegiance.
African teams, except when they were playing against France, were favored over those from the European Union.
As I watched the Croatia-Australia match early in the tournament, I surprised myself, too, as I realized that my emotions were with the Australian team, whatever that could mean, given that there were so many Croatians playing for Australia.
This deep search for identification should not be confused with a simple surge of nationalism. Reality is more complex.
And this is not only because many coaches of the national teams are, like in the good old days, “foreign mercenaries,” with this Cup’s Swiss guards including the Brazilian coaches of Japan and Portugal, the Swedish coach of England, and the French coach of Tunisia.
The Cup’s explosions of proud nationalism hide more tortured realities.
Nostalgia is not what it used to be.
In 1998, when France won the Cup for the first time, the three colors of the French flag (blue, white, and red) were celebrated alongside with the three colors (“black, white, andbeur,the skin color of North Africans born in France to immigrant parents) of the members of the French team.
But that innocence has been lost because it is no longer possible to celebrate the triumph of the French model of integration.
Indeed, after the violent episodes of the last year, France’s immigrant communities have a very different message to deliver: “Without us, you would not have had this World Cup success.
Do you believe you can continue to ostracize the communities from which your soccer heroes come?”
From ping-pong diplomacy with China to the united German Olympic team that competed in 1990 before actual reunification, sport has prefigured political developments, and politicians everywhere have seized on the importance of the World Cup.
Football success has become part of countries’ “soft power.”
France may not have the military might of the US or the growth rate of China and India, but its team reached the World Cup championship, raising its standing in the eyes of billions of people – and perhaps giving a reprieve to its unpopular government.
But sport can also become a kind of gigantic, distracting screen behind which nasty regimes do outrageous things – the very opposite of the Olympic and World Cup spirit.
As the world was watching the football games in Germany, North Korea was testing long-range missiles and Palestinians in the governing Hamas launched attacks on Israel that prompted a bloody invasion of Gaza.
The World Cup is drama, excitement, a dream, but it is also a form of “global escapism.”
Football may explain the world, but it does not improve it.
And now we are back to reality.
A Turning Point for Europe\u0027s Constitution
For the past several weeks, attention was focused on the war in Iraq and on the fault lines within Europe that the conflict exposed.
But at the same time--perhaps because no one was looking--a critical breakthrough occurred in the Convention for the Future of Europe, where the European Union's new constitution is being framed.
Representatives of 16 countries--Austria, Ireland, Portugal, the three Scandinavian countries, and the ten states that will join the EU in May 2004--submitted a proposal, in the form of a declaration, that calls for preserving the EU's current delicate institutional balance.
They recommend retaining the European Commission as the proto-executive branch, the European Council to speak for national interests, and the European Parliament as the institution that represents Europe's citizens directly.
They reaffirm member states' equality by defending the Council's rotating presidency.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });But, in addition to avoiding destructive changes, the proposal suggests a way forward for the Convention.
Specifically, it recommends a way to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Commission by allowing its president to be elected either by the Parliament or by an electoral college that also includes representatives from national parliaments.
This proposal is far superior to its predecessors.
Germany and France have proposed a system with two elected presidents--a Council president elected by its members and a Commission president elected by the European Parliament.
This is a strikingly bad idea. Creating a two-headed executive of this sort would guarantee continuous clashes between the two power centers.
The "Gang of 16" is absolutely right that the EU should have a single president, not two.
In a world of internal and external security threats, the EU will need a stronger executive capable of reacting quickly to unfolding events.
If the Council presidency continues to rotate, then the logical entity to vest with executive authority is the president of the Commission.
But currently the president of the Commission is remote and inadequately accountable to his ultimate constituents.
Fundamental political reform is needed.
Unfortunately, the proposal fails to choose between the two alternatives for reform that it presents: election of the Commission president by the European Parliament or by an electoral college that also includes representatives from national parliaments.
At first sight, these two options may seem similar. They are not.
The first alternative would steer the EU toward a parliamentary form of government, with the European Parliament entitled to both appoint and remove the Commission through a confidence vote. The electoral college method, however, could be a first step toward a presidential form of government.
The path to a parliamentary model is more familiar in Europe, and at first it may appear safer.
But in the long run it could become very slippery.
Given Europe's political heterogeneity, the European Parliament is unlikely to be ruled by a single-party majority.
A European Commission accountable to a divided European Parliament would thus be bogged down by the usual inefficiencies of coalition governments.
By contrast, a European Commission that is directly elected would have great legitimacy, as well as being insulated from political fights inside the European Parliament, thereby increasing its political effectiveness.
The main problem is that a directly elected Commission President might be premature: Europe may not be ready for such a radical change.

This is why the electoral college idea is so important: it allows for a gradual transition towards a regime that is desirable in the long run.
An electoral college would allocate seats to each country in proportion to its population, and each candidate would receive electoral college votes proportional to the vote taken in that country, either by universal suffrage or in the national parliament. This would force presidential candidates to campaign with equal energy in all countries.
Even better, the power to select the members of the electoral college should be given to national parliaments alone.
National parliaments have more legitimacy, attracting far higher voter turnout than elections to the European Parliament.
Europe would be brought closer to its citizens and national parliaments would gain a direct voice in EU decision making.
But delegates to the Convention should not stop there.
Countries should be given the option of allocating their electoral college votes via either universal suffrage or a vote in the national parliament.
The system could evolve toward one of direct election without having to amend the constitution.
Ultimately, the President of the Commission would be accountable directly to voters.
This is how the US gradually evolved into a presidential democracy, towards the mid-19th century.
Delegates to the Convention should keep in mind the provision of the Socratic Oath that reminds physicians, "First do no harm."
Beyond that, they can do genuine good by recognizing the merit of the proposal for an electoral college.
Xi in Russia
MOSCOW – The atmospherics surrounding Xi Jinping’s coming trip to Russia – his first visit to a foreign country as China’s new president – remind me of a slogan from my early childhood in the late 1950’s: “Russia-China, Friendship Forever.” The irony is that, even in that slogan’s heyday, Sino-Russian relations were deteriorating fast, culminating in spasms of combat along the Amur River in Siberia less than a decade later.
Is that slogan more valid now?
After China opened up its economy and Russia emerged from the Soviet Union, bilateral relations entered a new stage.
Goodwill now prevails, but some of the old suspicions linger – and some new ones have emerged.
Xi’s visit is not expected to usher in any breakthroughs.
A few deals to export Russian hydrocarbons to China can be expected, but not much more.
Nonetheless, the visit will highlight several important features of the bilateral relationship.
For starters, both the Russian and Chinese governments can afford to downplay the significance of their ties with the United States.
China views Russia as its strategic rear – and perhaps a base – in its escalating rivalry with the US (though not yet as an ally).
Russia’s leaders view Sino-American competition as a welcome addition to their country’s strategic weight, which, unlike China’s, is not being augmented by robust economic growth.
The more the US challenges the inevitable expansion of China’s “security perimeter,” the better for Russia, or so the Kremlin’s strategists appear to believe.
Meanwhile, the Sino-Russian relationship has achieved an unprecedented degree of warmth.
The Chinese are doing almost everything possible to placate Russian concerns.
The old border disputes have been silenced.
The volume of trade is growing rapidly.
Moreover, there has been no Chinese demographic expansion into Siberia, though many journalists and pundits have been peddling that story.
The number of Chinese residing in Russia – whether officially or clandestinely – amounts to 300,000. Many more Chinese lived in the Russian Empire before the 1917 revolution.
But, beneath the surface, unease in the bilateral relationship persists, partly for historical reasons.
Nationalist Chinese remember imperial Russia’s conquests, while many Russians have a morbid fear of the “yellow peril,” even though the Mongols conquered and reigned in China, while they were eventually repelled from Russia (not to mention that the Chinese never invaded Russia).
The more important reasons for the unease are the negative demographic trends in Russia’s far-eastern Trans-Baikal region, and the fear – shared by all of China’s neighbors – of overweening Chinese power.
Indeed, the pundits have a point: if the current economic near-stagnation in Siberia persists, the world will witness a second, epic edition of Finlandization, this time in the east.
That might not be the worst scenario a country could face, but it is not the most pleasant prospect for Russians, given their deeply ingrained sense of their status as a great power.
This scenario is not inevitable, and it certainly will not be on the minds of Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin when they meet in Moscow.
China is in the throes of an identity crisis as it faces an almost inevitable economic slowdown and the need to implement a new growth model.
Russia, meanwhile, is clearly suffering from an even deeper identity crisis.
It somehow survived the post-Soviet shock, and has now recovered.
Yet, for the last six years or so, Russia has been in a kind of limbo, with no strategy, no goals, and no elite consensus on a vision for the future.
For Sino-Russian relations, such fundamental uncertainties may be a blessing.
Both leaders can count on the other not to create additional problems, and even to help passively on geopolitical questions.
On Syria, for example, the two countries have shown that we are indeed living in a multipolar world.
And those new oil and gas deals will buttress both economies.
In the long term, Sino-Russian relations will depend largely on whether Russia overcomes its current stagnation and, among other steps, starts to develop the vast water and other resources of the Trans-Baikal region.
To do so, capital and technology will be needed not only from China, but also from Japan, South Korea, the US, and Southeast Asian countries.
The Trans-Baikal region could relatively easily expand ties with the resource-hungry Asian economies, to the benefit of all.
Even the labor problem is solvable, with millions of workers from former Soviet Central Asia – and perhaps from a gradually liberalizing North Korea – able to take part in the ambitious development that will be needed.
But the first step is to start to create conditions in the region that make living and working there attractive to Russians.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vladivostok last year created a mere enclave of development.
A growth strategy for the whole region is yet to come.
If it does not, the current Sino-Russian entente cordiale is almost certain to sour.
Russia will start to feel vulnerable, and will be pushed toward either geopolitical brinkmanship or submission to China’s will.
At this point, however, relations between China and Russia appear to be far better than the mythical friendship of my childhood.
Putin and Xi will do everything to emphasize that.
A Two-State Solution for Palestine?
In 1947 Palestinian Arabs and their allies rejected a UN proposal to partition Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state, just as ten years before they rejected a similar partitioning proposed by the Peel Commission.
More recently, both at Camp David and at Taba in Egypt, Arab negotiators again rejected proposals that would have led to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Apparently, many Palestinian Arabs, and much of the Arab world, continue to think that they can do better than a two-state solution.
After decades of conflict, it seems that the Arabs have not given up their goal of making all of Palestine into an Arab state.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });True, Arab leaders differ over tactics.
From time to time Arab negotiators enter into discussions about the mundane issues that prospective neighboring states would need to resolve, such as political boundaries, security arrangements, and economic relations.
It is possible that at some point the Arabs will agree among themselves that the creation of a Palestinian state that claims to be committed to peaceful coexistence with Israel will be a useful tactic.
American and European governments seem willing to use the carrot of economic aid to encourage this development, in the way that the US pays off Egypt and Jordan to acquiesce in the existence of Israel.
But, unless the Arabs reconcile themselves to the permanent reality of a Jewish state in Palestine, the creation of a Palestinian Arab state will not provide more than the temporary palliative of a tenuous truce between Arabs and Jews.
The Zionist project of creating a Jewish state in Palestine entails a return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland, a land in which Jews lived since biblical times and which the Diaspora never abandoned.
Whether or not this historical justification for Israel's creation is convincing, the important fact is that the Palestinian Arabs and their allies do not buy it.
Arabs express their disdain for Zionism by equating the Zionist project to the creation of a colony, to which millions of Jewish settlers have come.
According to this equation the conflict between Jews and Arabs replicates the conflicts between colonial settlers and indigenous peoples.
If the Arabs believe their own argument that Zionism is colonialism, with themselves as the victims, then, whether or not anybody else accepts this view, the lessons that the Arabs glean from colonial experiences become relevant to prospects for peace between Arabs and Israelis.
Over the years Israeli governments encouraged Arabs to participate in Israel's economy.
This policy, which Israelis view to be benevolent, supposes that economic integration of Arabs and Jews is possible without modifying the Zionist concept of Israel as a Jewish state.
But, from the Arab perspective this policy reinforces their equating of Zionism to colonialism.
Arab rhetoric often takes the colonial experiences of Algeria and South Africa as models for their conflict with Zionism.
These analogies are important because in both Algeria and South Africa, colonialism failed.
Descendants of the European settlers in Algeria fled back to Europe.
In South Africa, Blacks achieved political dominance over the descendants of British and Afrikaner settlers, large numbers of whom remain as a tolerated minority.
A permanent end to the conflict over Palestine will not be possible until the Palestinian Arabs and their allies become convinced that the failure of colonialism in countries like Algeria and South Africa is not a relevant lesson for them. In other words Arabs will have to become convinced that they can neither subjugate the Jews nor drive the Jews out of Palestine.
The negotiating formula of "land for peace" and "breakthroughs" like the Oslo accords failed to dampen the conflict because the Arabs understandably interpret Israeli concessions as signs of weakness.
Unfortunately, the Israelis can show the Arabs that they cannot destroy Israel only by enduring the violent war of attrition that the Arabs are pursuing.
Moreover, there seems no obvious way to speed up the process of convincing the Arabs that Israel is here to stay except by making this war of attrition as costly as possible for them.
But suppose a two-state solution were achieved in the not-too-remote future.
In thinking about this possibility we are drawn to the example of Ireland, where a two-state solution has worked.
Having secured an independent Irish state, Catholics in the Republic of Ireland came to accept the existence of a settler enclave in Northern Ireland.
But, the Irish story has not had a happy ending.
The Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, whose position seems similar to that of the million Arabs who are Israeli citizens, eventually revolted against the dominant Protestants, with decades of violence resulting.
Even if a Palestinian state committed to peaceful coexistence were created, down the road Israel may be unable to avoid the fate of Northern Ireland.
A Universal Library
MELBOURNE – Scholars have long dreamed of a universal library containing everything that has ever been written.
Then, in 2004, Google announced that it would begin digitally scanning all the books held by five major research libraries.
Suddenly, the library of utopia seemed within reach.
Indeed, a digital universal library would be even better than any earlier thinker could have imagined, because every work would be available to everyone, everywhere, at all times.
And the library could include not only books and articles, but also paintings, music, films, and every other form of creative expression that can be captured in digital form.
But Google’s plan had a catch.
Most of the works held by those research libraries are still in copyright.
Google said that it would scan the entire book, irrespective of its copyright status, but that users searching for something in copyrighted books would be shown only a snippet.
This, it argued, was “fair use” – and thus permitted under copyright laws in the same way that one may quote a sentence or two from a book for the purpose of a review or discussion.
Publishers and authors disagreed, and some sued Google for breach of copyright, eventually agreeing to settle their claim in exchange for a share of Google’s revenue.
Last month, in a Manhattan court, Judge Denny Chin rejected that proposed settlement, in part because it would have given Google a de facto monopoly over the digital versions of so-called “orphan” books – that is, books that are still in copyright, but no longer in print, and whose copyright ownership is difficult to determine.
Chin held that the United States Congress, not a court, was the appropriate body to decide who should be entrusted with guardianship over orphan books, and on what terms.
He was surely right, at least in so far as we are considering matters within US jurisdiction.
These are large and important issues that affect not only authors, publishers, and Google, but anyone with an interest in the diffusion and availability of knowledge and culture.
So, while Chin’s decision is a temporary setback on the way to a universal library, it provides an opportunity to reconsider how the dream can best be realized.
The central issue is this: how can we make books and articles – not just snippets, but entire works – available to everyone, while preserving the rights of the works’ creators?
To answer that, of course, we need to decide what those rights are.
Just as inventors are given patents so that they can profit from their inventions for a limited time, so, too, authors were originally given copyright for a relatively short period – in the US, it was initially only 14 years from the first publication of the work.
For most authors, that would be enough time to earn the bulk of the income that they would ever receive from their writings; after that, the works would be in the public domain.
But corporations build fortunes on copyright, and repeatedly pushed Congress to extend it, to the point that in the US it now lasts for 70 years after the creator’s death.
(The 1998 legislation responsible for the last extension was nicknamed the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because it allowed the Walt Disney Company to retain copyright of its famous cartoon character.)
It is because copyright lasts so long that as many as three-quarters of all library books are “orphaned.” This vast collection of knowledge, culture, and literary achievement is inaccessible to most people.
Digitizing it would make it available to anyone with Internet access.
As Peter Brantley, Director of Technology for the California Digital Library, has put it: “We have a moral imperative to reach out to our library shelves, grab the material that is orphaned, and set it on top of scanners.”
Robert Darnton, Director of the Harvard University Library, has proposed an alternative to Google’s plans: a digital public library, funded by a coalition of foundations, working in tandem with a coalition of research libraries.
Darnton’s plan falls short of a universal library, because works in print and in copyright would be excluded; but he believes that Congress might grant a non-commercial public library the right to digitize orphan books.
That would be a huge step in the right direction, but we should not give up the dream of a universal digital public library.
After all, books still in print are likely to be the ones that contain the most up-to-date information, and the ones that people most want to read.
Many European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand, have adopted legislation that creates a “public lending right” – that is, the government recognizes that enabling hundreds of people to read a single copy of a book provides a public good, but that doing so is likely to reduce sales of the book.
The universal public library could be allowed to digitize even works that are in print and in copyright, in exchange for fees paid to the publisher and author based on the number of times the digital version is read.
If we can put a man on the Moon and sequence the human genome, we should be able to devise something close to a universal digital public library.
At that point, we will face another moral imperative, one that will be even more difficult to fulfill: expanding Internet access beyond the less than 30% of the world’s population that currently has it.
A Universal Revolution
NEW YORK – The most important contribution of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 60 years ago, on December 10, 1948, was to assert a powerful idea: rights are universal.
Rights do not depend on membership of a particular community or citizenship in a certain state. They do not derive from a social contract.
Rather, because rights are universal, they are attributes of all human beings.
Indeed, they are part of what makes us human.
Each of us may enjoy rights. Those who exercise power may do so only in limited ways.
The limits are set by rights.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });It is, of course, possible to trace the concept of universal rights at least as far back as seventeenth-century English thinking about natural law.
The concept was partially embraced in the French Declaration of Rights of 1789 and, to a greater extent, in Thomas Jefferson’s language in the same era about “inalienable rights.”  It also shaped the thinking of those in England who led the anti-slavery struggle of the second half of the eighteenth century, the first human rights movement.
Yet the Universal Declaration marked a giant step forward, as the world’s governments – with abstentions from the Soviet bloc states, Saudi Arabia, and apartheid South Africa, but with no votes in opposition – agreed that rights should take precedence over state power.
One way to think about the six decades that have elapsed since the adoption of the Universal Declaration is as a struggle to implement its promises.
For a long time, it was a losing struggle, marked especially by the spread of both communist and anti-communist tyrannies.
Things began to change in the 1980’s with the fall of military dictatorships in Latin America and in such East Asian countries as the Philippines and South Korea, and with the growing number of people engaged in the struggle for human rights in the Soviet empire.
By the end of the decade, many Soviet bloc regimes had collapsed. 
A factor that contributed to their demise was a shift in thinking that transformed the conflict between East and West away from one that emphasized economic systems.  Instead, it was the contrast between totalitarianism and respect for rights that completely discredited the oppressive regimes linked to Moscow and helped to bring them down.
South Africa’s largely peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy in the early 1990’s was a further advance for rights.
But the last decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly stained by ethnic cleansing in ex-Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda, and during the current decade the tide has seemed to turn against the rights cause.
Powerful states such as China and Russia are not limiting themselves to authoritarian rule at home, but are also supporting those in other countries engaged in similar practices.
The same is true of lesser powers such as Iran and Venezuela.
Moreover, the United States has been squandering much of its capacity to promote human rights internationally.  In responding to the terrorist attacks on its own soil on September 11, 2001, the US has resorted to such measures as prolonged indefinite detention without charges, trials before military commissions lacking due process safeguards, and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees, including torture.
Other governments and intergovernmental bodies have not filled the gap left by the US.
The new UN Human Rights Council has so far disappointed those who hoped that it would be a more principled and effective body than its discredited predecessor, the UN Human Rights Commission.
The European Union has been a positive force in promoting rights in those countries aspiring to membership, but it has not demonstrated a capacity to exercise influence worldwide.
Today, the most effective force promoting human rights is global public opinion, informed and mobilized by the large and growing nongovernmental human rights movement, which, as in the recent war between Georgia and Russia, has focused international attention on violations of the laws of armed conflict that protect noncombatants.
It has also led the way in creating international criminal tribunals that prosecute and punish those who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
These achievements are not stopping war, but they are reducing the number of terrible human rights violations that accompany armed conflict.
It is, of course, dismaying that 60 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so many governments disregard the principles that they endorsed so long ago.
Yet without the legitimacy derived from the Universal Declaration and its role in promoting compliance, the nongovernmental human rights movement could not have developed into a global force.
The fact that the movement continues to secure advances even in difficult times is an indication of the enduring significance of what was achieved in 1948 when the world’s governments declared that rights are universal.
A Vital and Enduring Alliance
In recent years, many experts and commentators have said that the Atlantic Alliance would crumble or become irrelevant.
As a former ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), I can say from experience that such dire predictions are nothing new.
As America’s current Secretary of Defense, it is clear to me that the transatlantic partnership is as relevant and essential as ever.
Consider the historic events that have taken place in the past year and the role played by the United States and Europe.
NATO added seven new members – nations eager to contribute to the Alliance in powerful ways.
In Afghanistan, eight million voters, 40% of them women, chose their first democratically elected President in 5,000 years.
In the Palestinian Authority, a democratically elected president offers the hope of a new chance for peace.
In Ukraine, ordinary citizens demonstrated the depth of their commitment to free and fair elections.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In Iraq, Saddam Hussein’s former subjects braved threats and voted for the first time with ballots that offered a choice of 70 political parties, rather than only one.
Across the country, voters arrived on crutches and in donkey carts, passing by posters that threatened: “You vote, you die.”
What a damaging blow to the extremists, whose ideology the voters so clearly rejected.
While there have been differences over Iraq, such issues among longtime friends are not new.
Consider just a few of the divisions that have come up among NATO allies over the past decades.
In the 1960’s, France decided to pull out of the NATO integrated command and asked NATO forces to leave its territory.
In the 1980’s there was profound disagreement and controversy over President Ronald Reagan’s decision to deploy medium-range missiles in Europe.
In fact, as NATO Ambassador in the 1970’s, I had to fly back to testify against legislation in the US Congress to withdraw America’s forces from Europe in the middle of the Cold War.
Our Atlantic Alliance has navigated through some choppy seas over the years, but we have always been able to resolve the toughest issues.
That is because there is so much that unites us: common values, shared histories, and an abiding faith in democracy.
Today, we also share a common enemy.
Extremists have targeted all civilized societies across the globe: in New York and Washington; Istanbul; Madrid; Beslan; Bali; and more. They do not seek an armistice with the civilized world.
They will not negotiate a separate peace.
They would like nothing better than for America and Europe to be at odds, rather than working together.
The arrests of numerous terrorist suspects last month by French and German authorities made clear that no one nation can do the critical work necessary to win the struggle against extremists.
Often quietly, America and European nations are sharing intelligence, capturing terrorists, and disrupting their finances.
As a result, some three-quarters of known al-Qaeda leaders have been killed or captured, and others are on the run.
Nor can any one nation stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons.
This is why some 60 nations have joined the Proliferation Security Initiative in an effort to keep deadly weapons from dangerous regimes.
In 2003, German, Italian, British, and American authorities confiscated nuclear equipment bound for Tripoli, leading to Libya’s decision to open its weapons inventories to inspectors.
Every NATO nation has personnel serving in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, which just changed command from a French to a Turkish general.
One of NATO’s newest members, Lithuania, is taking leadership of a Provincial Reconstruction Team – joining other European nations in contributing to Afghanistan’s stability and progress.
Indeed, more than half of all NATO nations have had forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq.
As the Iraqi people take more steps along the challenging road to democracy, more NATO countries have agreed to help train Iraqi security personnel by providing funds or equipment and by establishing a war college and military academies.
Members of NATO share much more than an alliance; we are united by ties of blood and purpose, a heritage of liberty, and a calling to confront extremists’ violence – and defeat it.
In the 60 years since World War II came to an end, we have counted on each other in times of peril and challenge.
I am old enough to remember both the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall, and the ascent and collapse of Nazism, of Fascism, and of Soviet Communism.
Together the members of NATO have helped to protect Kosovo and recently brought aid to the victims of a devastating tsunami.
Great achievements are possible when the Atlantic community is united.
That unity need not mean a uniformity of tactics or views, but rather a union of purpose.
Those who cherish free political systems and free economic systems share similar hopes.
Working together, those hopes can become realities for many more people.
A Vote against Voting in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD &#45;&#45; As Pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on February 18, many observers hope that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government.
But sometimes democracy is best served by refusing to participate.
The upcoming election, to be held under the illegal Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) implemented following President Pervez Musharraf’s state of emergency on November 3, is such a case, which is why my party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote.
To be sure, contesting the election would provide my party with a great opportunity to take issues to the people.
In fact, my party’s support has been growing, with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most popular in the frontier province – and gaining ground in every other province.
But elections by themselves don’t bring democracy.
Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, loves elections.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been holding elections for 27 years.
Uzbekistan’s Islam Karimov has been in power for 30 years, and has just been “elected” to a fresh seven-year presidential term.
Elections are meaningful only if they are perceived to be free and fair, which requires independent referees.
When my party started eleven years ago, we called ourselves the Movement For Justice.
We demanded an independent judiciary, because we believed that democracy and prosperity are impossible without the rule of law, and that the rule of law requires a judiciary that can act as a constraint on the government.
Having gone to university in western countries, we were inspired by the American system of check and balances.
So it is a shock to us that the US State Department keeps talking about free and fair elections and abolishing the state of emergency, but without mentioning the reinstatement of the judges – including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court – that Musharraf illegally dismissed.
If the judges are not reinstated, how can there be free and fair elections?
Who decides what is free and fair?
Musharraf?
This is where the battle lines are now drawn, and where the future of the country will be decided.
If the Chief Justice and the judges are reinstated, we can move toward a genuine democratic system.
But if Musharraf manages to get his own PCO judges established in the country, then we will head toward a period of turmoil.
After all, how can the party of a man who has less than 5% support win the election now without rigging it?
Unfortunately, most of the political parties have failed to stand up for the democratic process.
Major parties like the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) have decided to participate, following the lead of the late Benazir Bhutto’s People’s Party.
And, of all the major parties that are contesting the election, only the PMLN is demanding the reinstatement of the judges.
Fortunately, the people of Pakistan – students, opinion makers, and, above all, lawyers – are standing up for the judges, doing the work that should have been done by political parties.
We see lawyers marching, getting beaten up, filling the jails, and yet remaining resolute.
They are suffering huge financial losses by boycotting the courts, and yet they are determined that the Chief Justice must be reinstated.
So the dividing line in Pakistan is not between liberals and extremists, but between those who support the status quo and those who oppose it.
Parties that call themselves democratic are not only going along with Musharraf in this fraudulent election, but are also helping to restore the status quo.
The solution to dysfunctional democracy is not military dictatorship, but more democracy.
Pakistanis understand democracy, because we have a democratic culture.
Our founder was a great constitutionalist, and Pakistan came into being through the vote.
The problem has been that because we have lacked an independent judiciary, we have not had an independent election commission.
So all our elections, except for one in 1970, have been rigged.
India, with which Pakistan shares a similar background, went through 40 years of dysfunctional democracy with a one-party system.
But in the last 16 years it has begun to reap the fruits of genuine democratic competition, because an independent judiciary and electoral commission gives people confidence that their vote can make a difference.
Until we have the same in Pakistan, no election can be free and fair.
For two and a half years, I supported Musharraf and believed his promises to bring genuine democracy to Pakistan.
I’ve learned my lesson about Musharraf.
But, more importantly, no military dictator can succeed where Musharraf has so clearly failed.
Winston Churchill once said, “War is too serious a business for generals.”
The same is true of democracy.
A Wake-Up Call for the ECB
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has allowed global stock markets to railroad him into a whopping 75-basis-point cut in interest rates just one week before the regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed’s decision-making Open Market Committee.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet would never allow this to happen to the ECB – he manipulates markets; markets don’t manipulate him.
Indeed, with America’s economy in apparent freefall, Trichet is threatening euro-zone trade unions with pre-emptive interest-rate hikes unless they behave as he sees fit.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });These threats may be proving counter-productive to the achievement of price stability in the euro-zone economy, the central bank’s primary objective.
For example, to make his threats of an interest-rate hike in the midst of a global slowdown credible, the ECB president is using his press conferences to tell the world how strong European growth is.
Besides being at odds with reality, the claim of strong growth actually encourages the trade unions to ask for even higher wages.
And why shouldn’t they if things are as good as Trichet claims?
Trichet also makes his job more difficult for himself by talking up Europe’s inflationary threat.
His colleague on the ECB Governing Council, Bundesbank president Axel Weber, seems to have gotten the message that the more ECB officials talk up inflationary fears, the more the trade unions will ask.
So he recently toned down his rhetoric by warning that euro-zone inflationary pressures should not be “over-dramatized.” 
How true!
The essential economic reality confronting the ECB today is that the American economy is falling headlong into a serious slump – Bernanke’s surprise cut speaks volumes to this.
It defies economic logic to think that the global economy – including Europe – will escape its consequences. 
As European growth slows, so will inflationary pressures.
So Trichet should relax, stop threatening others, and let the economic slowdown do the work for him.
Even with sticky wages and prices in Europe, the global slowdown will reduce energy, commodity, and food prices on world markets, all of which are important factors behind currently elevated European inflation levels.
The crude oil price already has dropped substantially from its highs at the beginning of the year.
But the evolving slowdown is not the only reason the threat of a wage-price spiral in Europe is overblown.
Germany is facing a key wage negotiation with public-sector unions.
Even if the unions win large wage increases – which is very likely and entirely justifiable given their past restraint – this will have only a negligible effect on Europe’s price stability.
Increased public-sector wage costs mean increased government spending on wages.
If this is financed by cutbacks elsewhere in the budget, the main consequence will be only a re-distribution of government spending, which is not necessarily inflationary.
Nor is it inflationary if the wage increases are financed by higher taxes.
Only if the budget surplus diminishes would there be an inflationary impact, and that would not be due to a wage-price spiral, but to an increase in net government demand, which actually might not be a bad thing for an economy facing a potentially severe economic slowdown.
In the United States, it should be remembered, the need for a fiscal stimulus developed, so it seems, out of the blue.
The same may happen in Europe, especially given the ECB’s refusal to cut interest rates.
A decent settlement with public-sector workers could give Germany a “backdoor” fiscal stimulus just at the right moment – when aggregate demand is flagging.
The real problem with a generous wage settlement with public-sector unions is that private-sector unions could use it to get more than their productivity gains warrant.
Contracts with the metal and chemical workers also are coming up for negotiation this year in Germany, and union leaders are talking tough.
Berthold Huber, the head of Germany’s huge IG Metall engineering union, recently promised his rank and file “a mega year” for pay increases.
But the global slowdown, which takes the fangs out of the strike threat, will keep private-sector workers in line no matter how much their leaders may rant and rave.
Everyone, including bellicose trade unionists, tends to become more reasonable when the economy turns south.
Rather than encourage the unions with exaggerated talk of strong European growth and inflationary excess – and disrespect them with threats and interventions – Trichet should speak softly and let nature take its course.
Dethroning King Coal
MELBOURNE – Earlier this year, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 400 parts per million (ppm).
The last time there was that much CO2 in our atmosphere was three million years ago, when sea levels were 24 meters higher than they are today.
Now sea levels are rising again.
Last September, Arctic sea ice covered the smallest area ever recorded.
All but one of the ten warmest years since 1880, when global records began to be kept, have occurred in the twenty-first century.
Some climate scientists believe that 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is already enough to take us past the tipping point at which we risk a climate catastrophe that will turn billions of people into refugees.
They say that we need to get the amount of atmospheric CO2 back down to 350 ppm.
That figure lies behind the name taken by 350.org, a grassroots movement with volunteers in 188 countries trying to solve the problem of climate change.
Other climate scientists are more optimistic: they argue that if we allow atmospheric CO2 to rise to 450 ppm, a level associated with a two-degree Celsius temperature rise, we have a 66.6% chance of avoiding catastrophe.
That still leaves a one-in-three chance of catastrophe – worse odds than playing Russian roulette. And we are forecast to surpass 450 ppm by 2038.
One thing is clear: if we are not to be totally reckless with our planet’s climate, we cannot burn all the coal, oil, and natural gas that we have already located.
About 80% of it – especially the coal, which emits the most CO2 when burned – will have to stay in the ground.
In June, US President Barack Obama told students at Georgetown University that he refused to condemn them and their children and grandchildren to “a planet that’s beyond fixing.” Saying that climate change cannot wait for Congress to overcome its “partisan gridlock,” he announced measures using his executive power to limit CO2 emissions, first from new fossil-fuel power plants, and then from existing ones.
Obama also called for an end to public financing of new coal plants overseas, unless they deploy carbon-capture technologies (which are not yet economically viable), or else there is, he said, “no other viable way for the poorest countries to generate electricity.”
According to Daniel Schrag, Director of Harvard University’s Center for the Environment and a member of a presidential science panel that has helped to advise Obama on climate change, “Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal.
On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed.”
Schrag is right.
His university, like mine and many others, has a plan to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions.
Yet most of them, including Schrag’s and mine, continue to invest part of their multi-billion-dollar endowments in companies that extract and sell coal.
But pressure on educational institutions to stop investing in fossil fuels is beginning to build.
Student groups have formed on many campuses, and a handful of colleges and universities have already pledged to end their investment in fossil fuels.
Several US cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have agreed to do the same.
Now financial institutions, too, are coming under fire for their involvement with fossil fuels.
In June, I was part of a group of prominent Australians who signed an open letter to the heads of the country’s biggest banks asking them to stop lending to new fossil-fuel extraction projects, and to sell their stakes in companies engaged in such activities.
Speaking at Harvard earlier this year, former US Vice President Al Gore praised a student group that was pushing the university to sell its investments in fossil-fuel companies, and compared their activities to the divestment campaign in the 1980’s that helped to end South Africa’s racist apartheid policy.
How fair is that comparison?
The dividing lines may be less sharp than they were with apartheid, but our continued high level of greenhouse-gas emissions protects the interests of one group of humans – mainly affluent people who are alive today – at the cost of others.
(Compared to most of the world’s population, even the American and Australian coal miners who would lose their jobs if the industry shut down are affluent.)
Our behavior disregards most of the world’s poor, and everyone who will live on this planet in centuries to come.
Worldwide, the poor leave a very small carbon footprint, but they will suffer the most from climate change.
Many live in hot places that are getting even hotter, and hundreds of millions of them are subsistence farmers who depend on rainfall to grow their crops.
Rainfall patterns will vary, and the Asian monsoon will become less reliable.
Those who live on this planet in future centuries will live in a hotter world, with higher sea levels, less arable land, and more extreme hurricanes, droughts, and floods.
In these circumstances, to develop new coal projects is unethical, and to invest in them is to be complicit in this unethical activity.
While this applies, to some extent, to all fossil fuels, the best way to begin to change our behavior is by reducing coal consumption.
Replacing coal with natural gas does reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, even if natural gas itself is not sustainable in the long term.
Right now, ending investment in the coal industry is the right thing to do.
A War on Tolerance
AMSTERDAM &#45;&#45; When “tolerance” becomes a term of abuse in a place like the Netherlands, you know that something has gone seriously wrong.
The Dutch always took pride in being the most tolerant people on earth.
In less feverish times than these, no one could possibly have taken exception to Queen Beatrix’s speech last Christmas, when she pleaded for tolerance and “respect for minorities.”
But Geert Wilders, leader of the right-wing, anti-Muslim Freedom Party, was so disgusted by the Dutch queen’s “multi-cultural rubbish” that he wanted her to be stripped of her constitutional role in the government.
Wilders, a popular rabble-rouser whose party occupies nine seats in the Dutch parliament, compares the Koran to Hitler’s Mein Kampf, wants to stop Muslims from moving to the Netherlands, and thunders that those who are already in the country should tear up half the Koran if they wish to stay.
Tolerance towards Islam is cowardly appeasement in his eyes.
He thinks that Europe is in peril of being “Islamized.” “There will soon be more mosques than churches,” he says, if true Europeans don’t have the guts to stand up and save Western civilization.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Notwithstanding his call to ban the Koran, Wilders and his admirers claim to believe in unfettered free speech as a Western birthright.
Beatrix stated that the right to free speech does not automatically mean the right to offend.
Wilders disagrees.
No criticism of Islam, however offensive, should ever be hampered by political correctness.
Wilders uses every opportunity to test Muslims’ (often very limited) tolerance.
His latest provocation is a short film denouncing Islam, which is yet to be shown, but has already caused panic all around.
Remarkably for a Dutch politician – and a minor one, at that – news of Wilders’s antics has reached the world press.
So Dutch embassies are bracing themselves for violent demonstrations, and the government is considering special security measures.
Some commentators suggest that Wilders, born and raised as a Catholic in a provincial Dutch town, is, like his Muslim enemies, a true believer, driven by the goal of keeping Europe “Judeo-Christian.” Perhaps, but this is probably a red herring.
His war on Islam is also, and perhaps even mainly, a war on the cultural and political elites, the Dutch intellectual establishment, the Eurocrats of Brussels, and the liberal-minded queen.
Indeed, his speeches are studded with references to arrogant elites who are out of touch with the feelings of the common man. “Tolerance” is seen as weak and elitist, typical of people who live far removed from the harsh realities of the street, where violent and unruly foreigners menace upstanding Dutch folks.
This notion of the elitist appeaser is not confined to the Netherlands.
In Israel, the educated Jewish activists who criticize Israeli abuses against Palestinians, the peaceniks who believe that negotiation is better than violence and that even Arabs have rights, are called, with a knowing sneer, “beautiful souls.”
The common man, rooted in the real world, supposedly knows better: uncompromising toughness, the hard line, is the only way to get results.
In the United States, the word “liberal,” in the mouths of populist radio hosts and right-wing politicians, has become almost synonymous with “effete East Coast snob” or, worse, “New York intellectual.”
Liberals, in this view, are not only soft, but are somehow distinctly un-American.
The association of elites with foreignness, tolerance, and metropolitan cities is nothing new.
Elites often can speak foreign languages, and big cities are traditionally more tolerant and open to mixed populations.
Modern populism – American politicians running, or pretending to run, “against Washington,” or French populists speaking for “deep France” – is invariably hostile to capital cities.
Brussels, the capital of the European Union, stands for everything populists, whether left or right, hate.
And Muslim immigrants live in Amsterdam, London, or Marseilles, not in the kind of small towns where right-wing populists find most of their support.
Still, the politics of resentment works best when it can tap into real fears.
There are reasons for people to feel anxious about economic globalization, pan-European bureaucracy, the huge and not always effectively controlled influx of immigrants, and the aggression of radical political Islam.
These anxieties have too often been ignored.
There is a sense among many Europeans, not just in the Netherlands, that they have been abandoned in a fast-changing world, that multi-national corporations are more powerful than nation-states, that the urban rich and highly educated do fine and ordinary folks in the provinces languish, while democratically elected politicians are not only powerless, but have abjectly surrendered to these larger forces that threaten the common man.
Tolerance is seen as not just weak, but as a betrayal.
The Muslim threat is, of course, not a fantasy.
A small number of ideological extremists has inflicted real violence in the name of Islam, and will continue to do so. But the popular resentment of Islam goes deeper and wider.
Wilders, and others like him, are not just attacking Islamic extremists.
His success is based on that sense of tolerance as betrayal.
And, as so often happens, the loathing of elites has found an outlet in the loathing of outsiders, who look different and whose ways are strange.
We must fight Islamic extremism, but not by tapping into the darkest gut feelings of the unthinking mob.
Nothing good ever came from that.
A Warrant of Hypocrisy
LONDON – Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) upheld the request of the court’s chief prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Omar el-Bashir, the President of Sudan, charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Bashir responded by expelling foreign aid agencies looking after the refugee camps in Darfur.
This is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes, with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism.
Both positions are hopelessly buried in intellectual and moral fog.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The warrant was no leap forward.
From the legal point of view, it makes no difference whether the accused is a sitting or former head of state.
But it makes an enormous practical difference that an incumbent ruler can do a lot more future damage to his people than an ex-ruler, and therefore should be given no incentive to retaliate.
As a result of Bashir’s policies, 300,000 people are estimated to have died and 2.7 million displaced in Darfur.
The expulsion of the aid agencies has put over a million Darfuris at risk of epidemics and starvation.
According to the statute that established the ICC, the prosecutor is required to ensure that any prosecution is in the interests of the victims as well as of justice.
But, to lawyers like the ICC prosecutor, the abstract claims of justice are more vivid than any concrete duty of protection.
In this case, justice comes with poisoned arrows.
Emboldened by the warrant and its elusive suggestion of international support, the Darfuri rebels, the Justice and Equality Movement, have walked out of peace talks with Sudan’s government.
Meanwhile, Bashir, with little to lose, will no doubt take the opportunity to attack his enemies.
The counter-argument is that the threat of indictment will deter rulers from wicked behavior.
But the law will deter only if its sanctions are credible.
A law that cannot be enforced deters no one. In fact, it weakens respect for law.
Moreover, while the fear of being hauled off to The Hague may havesome effect in deterring rulers from committing crimes against humanity, the claim that the Bashir warrant will deter the current crop of human rights’ violators is derisory.
Indeed, it is likely to prolong wicked regimes.
Robert Mugabe, for example, refuses to leave office – at great cost to Zimbabwe’s people – for fear of being put on trial.
Whatever the attractions of giving criminals “nowhere to hide, whatever the consequences,” the consequences cannot be ignored when the criminals are heads of state.
The policy of never negotiating with terrorists cannot be scaled up to state level when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake.
The charge of colonialism, meanwhile, is simply reflex: colonialism no longer exists.
The charge that international law isjust “western law” is also rubbish.
International law is the conscience of mankind.
But the perception that the law is selectively applied happens to be true.
In the Nuremberg trial of 1946, which laid the basis of current international law, the main charge against the Nazi leaders was that of “planning and waging aggressive war.”
Prohibition of war except for self-defense is embedded in the United Nations Charter.
But the ICC’s creators deemed the waging of aggressive war – which the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg called “the supreme international crime” – to be outside the court’s jurisdiction. This guaranteed legal immunity for the leaders who carried out the invasion of Iraq.
The charge of selective application also applies to the Bashir warrant.
Bashir stands accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The latter were first defined in the Nuremberg principles of 1950 to include murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and “other inhumane acts.”
In 1998, these other acts were clarified to mean false imprisonment, torture, rape, persecution of a group, enforced disappearance of persons, and apartheid.
It comes as no surprise, then, to read in theArab News that Bashir’s warrant “reeks of hypocrisy.”
Where, indeed, are the arrest warrants for Bush and Cheney?
Does extraordinary rendition not count as “enforced disappearance of persons”? Does the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not count as torture?
Why is Vladimir Putin not standing trial for war crimes in Chechnya?
The answer is simple: where the interests of a UN Security Council member or one of their clients are at stake, the court’s jurisdiction ends.
The ICC is like a cobweb: small flies get stuck, but wasps and hornets get through.
Until the United States ratifies the ICC treaty, the Court is bound to seem to many to be little more than a politicized kangaroo court.
Without American support, it has little hope of earning legitimacy, let alone doing its job effectively.
The Security Council has the power to defer the warrant for Bashir’s arrest for renewable periods of one year.
It can do this indefinitely, and it seems likely that it will.
The idea is that deferring the warrant will give the Security Council leverage over Sudan.
Gareth Evans, a former Australian Foreign Minister, has called it “a powerful diplomatic tool,” while theWashington Post has called for the warrant to be used “as a bargaining chip with Mr. Bashir and his Chinese and Arab allies.”
They believe that the threat of arrest can be used to force Bashir to mend his ways.
If this proves true, the ICC and its sponsors have muddled justice with diplomacy.
If the world can dispense justice only at the expense of the weak and to the advantage of the strong, it should stick to the older tools of crime prevention: force and negotiation, and leave justice out of it.
A Watershed Doctrine for America
LOS ANGELES – As the United States stumbles through its economic challenges at home, the pressure of world events will not subside.
But America’s ability to address them has changed.
Its fiscal weakness limits its ability to act as global policeman.
Despite the relatively costless overthrow of the Qaddafi regime, America’s prolonged interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have severely strained the public’s tolerance for an active foreign policy.
Nonetheless, the US seems destined to remain the world’s most important actor for the foreseeable future. But today it is an actor without a script – it lacks a strategic guide comparable to the Cold War’s containment doctrine to prioritize policy.
Quite simply, the ad hoc policymaking that directed interventions in the Balkans, Somalia, southwest Asia, and the Middle East in the past two decades will not suffice in this new era of limitations.
This suggests that the US should seek out an overarching strategy to discipline its impulses to fight wars of choice or engage in nation-building efforts.
President Barack Obama’s 2010 National Security Strategy nurtures broad policy aspirations – “[n]ow we must position the United States to champion mutual interests among nations and peoples” – but falls short as a practical guide.
I suggest an alternative strategy, one already embedded in America history, though largely unrecognized.
But making explicit what lies implicit can sharpen US decision-making.
I call this strategy the “Watershed Doctrine.” A watershed is a tipping point, a turning point, a game changer.
When the US has confronted a “negative watershed” – a lethal threat to the country – it committed meaningful financial and human resources in order to address the risks.
Positive watersheds – opportunities to engineer seismic shifts in international or regional political affairs through nation-building, or to use economic and military assistance to prevent plausible negative watersheds – demand an equal level of commitment.
The Watershed concept provides policymakers with a standard to use – or at the very least to debate.
It is an organizing tool for policymaking: Is an international challenge a watershed or not?
If so, get involved.
If not, stay out.
We find watersheds throughout American history.
The War of 1812 and the Civil War are clear examples.
Had American forces not expelled the British from US territory in the first, and had Abraham Lincoln and the Union not prevailed in the second, the country would have been balkanized and unable to become the dominant power of the twentieth century.
By contrast, America’s flirtation with colonialism in the Spanish American War, its involvement in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean throughout the twentieth century, and, arguably, World War I, were not watersheds for the US.
But America’s inability after the Great War to overcome Old World politics at Versailles and isolationism at home marked a failed opportunity to promote a positive watershed.
That failure placed the world on the path to the negative watershed posed by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
Nothing foreordained that the US and its allies would prevail.
Had the Axis’s negative watershed succeeded, the US would have become a far different country.
A positive watershed, under-appreciated today, developed in the years immediately after World War II with the political transformation of Germany and Japan.
America’s remarkable investment of resources in this outcome made both countries stable, peaceful democracies, thereby eliminating them as adversaries and turning them into vital bulwarks against the next harbinger of a negative watershed, the Soviet Union.
Unlike the battle against the Axis, the US fought the Cold War in many ways, on many fronts, and over many decades – using politics, economics, and nuclear deterrence, as well as limited armed action, to ensure the USSR’s containment.
In time, the US had to accept that each political contest or military battle lost was not a watershed as long as its core interests in Europe, the Far East, and Latin America were not threatened.
Through trial and error – backed by a durable political and economic system – the US prevailed and the Soviet Union disintegrated.
The rise of Islamic fundamentalism poses another historic challenge, though one that is far more inchoate than any that the US has faced before.
In other times, the challenge would not even be called a watershed.
But the risk that weapons of mass destruction could be turned against the US makes it so.
Then there is the “Arab Spring,” a potential positive watershed that calls upon the US to decide how deep a political, economic, and military commitment it ought to make to nurture positive results.
Today, the US is a more sober and realistic country than it was in the heyday of the early post-Cold War period.
But, in the aftermath of setbacks in regions where it intervened, and with heightened economic distress at home, the US finds itself uncertain about how to respond to changing global events.
Pursuing a “Watershed Doctrine” might provide the right answer.
A Way out of Tibet’s Morass
NEW YORK – China has survived the 50th anniversary of the failed uprising by Tibetans against Chinese rule in 1959 without major protests.
But, to keep Tibetans off the streets, China’s government had to saturate the entire Tibetan plateau with troops and secretly detain in unmarked jails hundreds of people for “legal education.”
Those moves suggest that Tibet has become an increasingly serious concern for China’s rulers, one that they have not yet found ways to handle without damaging their standing in Tibet and around the world.
A year ago, Chinese and Western intellectuals competed in dismissing popular interest in Tibet as a childlike confusion with the imaginary Shangri-la of the 1937 filmLost Horizon.
But after more than 150 protests in Tibet against Chinese rule over the past 12 months, concerns about the area seem anything but fanciful.
Indeed, Tibet could soon replace Taiwan as a factor in regional stability and an important issue in international relations.
The areas populated by Tibetans cover a quarter of China; to have such a large part of the country’s territory under military control and cut off from the outside world weakens the Communist Party’s claims to legitimacy and world power status.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Last year’s protests were the largest and most widespread in Tibet for decades.
Participants included nomads, farmers, and students, who in theory should have been the most grateful to China for modernizing Tibet’s economy.
Many carried the forbidden Tibetan national flag, suggesting that they think of Tibet as a separate country in the past, and in about 20 incidents government offices were burned down.
In one case, there were even attacks on Chinese migrants, leading to 18 deaths.
It is hard not to see these events as a challenge to China’s rule.
The government’s reaction was to blame the problem on outside instigation.
It sent in more troops, hid details of protestors’ deaths, gave a life sentence to an AIDS educator who had copied illegal CDs from India, and for months banned foreigners and journalists from the Tibetan plateau.
In November, Chinese officials, live on national TV, ridiculed Tibetan exiles’ proposals for negotiation.
They canceled a European summit because of a meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the Dalai Lama, and regularly imply that Tibetans are terrorists.
On March 28, Tibetans in Lhasa had to celebrate “Serf Emancipation Day” to endorse China’s explanation for its take-over 50 years ago.
But such class-struggle terminology reminds people of the Cultural Revolution and, since such language would be unimaginable in inland China today, only makes Tibet seem more separate.
Although both sides claim to be ready for dialogue, they are talking at cross-purposes: the exiles say that talks must be based on their autonomy proposals, while China says that it will discuss only the Dalai Lama’s “personal status” – where he would live in Beijing should he return to China.
Visceral sparring matches are continuing, with the Dalai Lama recently describing Tibetans’ lives under China as a “hell on earth.”
He was almost certainly referring to life during the Maoist years rather than the present, but his remarks enabled China to issue more media attacks and raise the political temperature further.
Western governments have been accused of interference, but it is unlikely that any want to derail their relations with China, especially during an economic crisis.
Last October, British Foreign Minister David Miliband was so anxious to maintain Chinese good will that he came close to denouncing his predecessors’ recognition of Tibet’s autonomy 100 years ago.
But foreign concerns about the status of China’s mandate in Tibet are understandable: Tibet is the strategic high ground between the two most important nuclear powers in Asia.
Good governance on the plateau is good for everyone.
China could help to lessen growing tensions by recognizing these concerns as reasonable.
The Dalai Lama could cut down on foreign meetings and acknowledge that, despite China’s general emasculation of intellectual and religious life in Tibet, some aspects of Tibetan culture (like modern art, film and literature) are relatively healthy.
Western observers could accept the exiles’ assurances that their proposals on autonomy are negotiable and not bottom-line demands, rather than damning them before talks start.
All sides would gain by paying attention to two Tibetan officials in China who dared to speak out last month.
A retired prefectural governor from Kardze told the Singapore paperZaobao that “the government should have more trust in its people, particularly the Tibetan monks,” and the current Tibet governor admitted that some protesters last year “weren’t satisfied with our policies,” rather than calling them enemies of the state, the first official concession from within China that some of its policies might be connected to the recent protests.
The Party has so far been following a more conventional strategy: last week it sent a delegation of officials to the US (the first ever sent, it said, to have been composed solely of Tibetans – a fact that one might expect them to have been embarrassed to admit) and had its leader, Shingtsa Tenzin Choedak, tell journalists that Tibetans enjoy freedom of religion.
As anyone who has worked in Tibet recently knows well, this was an inexactitude: since at least 1996, all Tibetans who work for the government and all Tibetan students in Tibet have been forbidden any Buddhist practice, even though it is illegal under Chinese law to stop people from practicing an official religion.
China’s government could improve the situation overnight by sacking the officials responsible for such illegal policies, and by apologizing to Tibetans for having overlooked such abuses for 15 years.
And it could start reassessing its Tibetan policies instead of increasing controls and allegations.
Until then, China’s quest for international respect is set to remain elusive and Tibet is likely to stay on the world’s agenda.
A Weak Start for START
LOS ANGELES – A strange sense of déjà vu is gripping Washington these days, as the debate over ratification by the United States Senate of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia heats up.
Spats have broken out between the Obama administration, future presidential contenders, senators, and arms control and defense experts.
There may not be nostalgia for the Cold War in any of this, but much of that era’s mindset can be perceived again in the arguments being knocked about.
The Senate must decide whether New START enhances American security.
Unfortunately, whatever the decision -- which has been delayed perhaps until late Fall to allow Obama’s administration more time to muster support for the treaty -- the US and Russian governments will continue to place each other in the nuclear crosshairs for the foreseeable future.
New START builds on a legacy of strategic nuclear arms limitation that goes back to the 1970’s.
Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger captured the allure in recent testimony: “The subject of nuclear arms control grew out of the seemingly paradoxical effort of those who had created the largest and most destructive arsenals to avoid by negotiation the ultimate consequences of their own decisions.”
Over the years “avoiding…the ultimate consequences” through limitations butted against the bitter legacy of the surprise attacks suffered by both the US and Russia in World War II.
After the war, each adopted a “never be surprised again” policy, and so went on to invest trillions of dollars in a multitude of hardened, mobile, and concealed nuclear weapons to deter the other.
The result produced tens of thousands of nuclear warheads.
In time, strategic arms control treaties became the measure of the political relationship.
With the Soviet Union’s collapse, a unique opportunity to end the nuclear competition emerged.
While elimination did take place in the former Soviet Republics, the Kremlin hung on to its nuclear arsenal – the last vestige of Russia’s former superpower status.
Likewise, US administrations have remained wedded to the Bomb.
As a result, the “nuclear hostage” relationship of the Cold War continued, capped in 2002 by the Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty, which set the upper limit on warheads at 2,200 by 2012.
In the spring of 2009, speaking in Prague, Obama advanced a bold ambition: a world without nuclear weapons.
But his audacity confronted a world in which the Bomb remained at the heart of many countries’ deterrence strategies.
Obama muddled his message further by admitting that he did not expect to see abolition in his lifetime.
Nonetheless, New START marks a step in the direction of disarmament.
It would limit each country to 1,550 strategic warheads on 700 deployed delivery vehicles.
Verification relies on 18 on-site inspections, notification of forces in and out of service, missile-test flight information and other data exchanges, plus a consultative commission to iron out compliance.
Were the US Senate to fail to ratify New START, the treaty’s proponents argue that the US would lose predictability about Russia’s nuclear activities, resulting in greater distrust and risk of miscalculation, making both sides less secure.
But arms-control skeptics take issue with this.
Throughout the Cold War, they viewed restraints on America’s development and fielding of nuclear weapons as compromising national security.
Fears that the Soviet Union would cheat reinforced their position.
And cheating did indeed upset the broader superpower relationship.
Today, similar apprehensions stoke opposition to New START.
To allay such concerns, the Obama administration committed to a multi-year increase in the budgets of the US military’s nuclear-weapons laboratories.
And in the April 10 release of the Nuclear Posture Review, Obama’s administration warned nuclear-armed states and others tempted to violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that they would remain nuclear targets.
Missile defense has become another bone of contention.
The language in the preamble to New START states that the agreement will not “undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.”
Critics contend that the clause, along with the Kremlin’s implied warning that it could withdraw from the treaty unilaterally were America’s defenses to become too robust, provides the Kremlin with leverage to impede deployment of any strategic missile-defense system.
The Obama administration repeatedly denies such claims, along with others that the treaty’s verification provisions remain insufficient.
It scoffs at assertions that Russia would cheat by multiplying warheads on bombers or new rail-based missile carriers, arguing that the Kremlin would want to avoid America’s compensatory response.
But Obama’s team does concede one point: New START fails to curtail Russia’s large numerical advantage in tactical nuclear weapons.
Arguing that short-range devices pose no risk to the American homeland, US negotiators plan to press for reductions in follow-on talks.
Despite the claims by both the Bush and Obama administrations that Russia and the US are no longer adversaries, it seems that the rapprochement has not translated into elimination of mutual nuclear targeting.
The result, even if new START is ratified, should satisfy no one.
A Window of Opportunity for European Defense
MADRID – With budgets exceptionally tight in Europe nowadays, worries about European defense have been growing.
Paradoxically, however, developments in 2010 offer hope for the future.
The defense agreement signed in November by France and the United Kingdom is composed of two treaties, which cover joint deployment of their armed forces, nuclear deterrence, and improved equipment and communications.
This initiative has the firm political backing of both countries’ leaders, and expresses a clear determination to unite against common threats.
Implemented correctly, these treaties could become a hopeful precedent for the entire European Union.
By transcending strictly national limits, these treaties chart the future path of European defense and will help determine the course of Europe’s relations with the United States and NATO.
To better judge the treaties’ worth, we must remember the context in which they were conceived.
In 1998, the Saint Malo Declaration by French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair indicated both countries’ determination to reinforce the EU’s security and defense capabilities.
Originally reluctant to accept a Europe with autonomous military capacity, the United Kingdom had learned from the intervention in Kosovo that the EU must be able to respond to crises rapidly and efficiently.
The Saint Malo Declaration signaled that the EU’s leading military powers were prepared to develop their own defense policy, though one not fully autonomous of NATO.
Indeed, through the Berlin Plus agreements, which facilitate use of NATO resources for missions undertaken under the European Defense and Security Policy (ESDP), NATO recognized the ESDP’s maturation over the past decade.
Indeed, the EU has undertaken 24 missions in Europe, Africa, and Asia, differing in nature, scope, and aims, and combining military and civilian means.
Today, the EU is being asked to conduct complex missions in adverse circumstances.
In doing so, Europe must draw on the lessons of its past successes.
We Europeans need to respond favorably, quickly, and effectively.
Defense missions must be more adaptable, prompt, multinational, and multi-instrumental.
They must be focused on stability and security, regardless of the security situation or the nature of the conflict.
Yet it is clear that European defense is now struggling mightily with public financing.
Moreover, the latest Eurobarometer poll shows that defense is the last thing that Europeans are worried about.
It is precisely here that the Franco-British agreement becomes vitally important.
The treaties mark an attempt to balance action and ambition in a context of economic crisis, fiscal consolidation, large-scale defense transformations, increasing interdependencies, and global threats – from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to climate change, resource scarcity, and epidemics – that are impossible to tackle unilaterally.
It also sets a precedent for the UK, preparing the way for future prime ministers to make advances in this direction.
Reinforcing both countries’ military capacities indirectly reinforces those of the EU.
The quest for synergies and efficiency that is implied by the agreement could well become a driving force for the European Defense Agency.
The British may now consider the EDA a defense expenditure, but, when better defined, it could represent a source of savings for every EU country.
Moreover, the agreements foresee cooperation on cyber-security, terrorism, satellite communications, and maritime security, which are also key elements of the Lisbon Treaty.
Likewise, the joint expeditionary forces established under the treaties could lead to the eventual creation of a wider structure, as they already contemplate “bilateral cooperation with NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, or other operations.”
Solidarity and agreement on political objectives are the pressing concerns of our age.
The new pact between France and the UK could be a historic step toward rationalizing defense spending rather than toward demilitarizing Europe.
It all depends on the path chosen.
In times of financial crisis, EU member states are unlikely to increase defense spending.
But if France and the UK understand how much their projection of power is linked to that of Europe, if they make cooperation reciprocal and expand it to other European countries – according to the formula foreseen in the treaties – we could eventually see an EU with the ability to assume the defense role expected of it by the global community.
By forcing greater efficiency and collaboration, misfortune can yield benefit.
This path can also ease US concerns about lower European defense spending.
The Franco-British treaties do not address commitments to NATO, a key US interest, because any reduction in the number of European troops deployed abroad inevitably implies a greater economic burden for the US.
The Franco-British agreement does, however, imply progress toward joint European military action, both in Europe and on the international scene, which will encourage the US.
So will the fact that the initiative comes from Europe’s two major military powers (whose combined defense spending represents half of the Continent’s total), both of which have permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
All of this is part of the transatlantic community’s continuing transformation from a set of organizations designed to defend territory against a known aggressor to something more flexible and dynamic.
Establishing joint management and overhauling conventional defense capacities will be a two-pronged challenge: functional, owing to the traditional schema of defense organizations, and political, inasmuch as a cession of state sovereignty will be required.
Another, equally important challenge is cooperation between NATO and Russia, which agreed at NATO’s Lisbon summit in November to collaborate on the Alliance’s anti-missile defenses.
This relationship must be based on cooperation that benefits both sides, and that respects certain common principals of governance and non-interference.
But coordinating and sharing capacities can help both partners deal with the new nature of conflicts.
Here, the EU can exercise leadership, for this is a political process that has only just begun.
As British Prime Minister David Cameron said of the agreement with France: “This is the beginning of something new, not an end in itself” – words that echo those of Jean Monet, one of the Union’s founding fathers, on cooperation in the West. “This is not an end in itself,” Monet said.
“It is the beginning of the path toward a more ordered world that we must attain if we want to escape destruction.”
The Franco-British agreement in 2010 was one hopeful sign for 2011 and beyond: a step along the arduous but necessary path toward greater European security.
A World Bank for a New World
NEW YORK – The world is at a crossroads.
Either the global community will join together to fight poverty, resource depletion, and climate change, or it will face a generation of resource wars, political instability, and environmental ruin.
The World Bank, if properly led, can play a key role in averting these threats and the risks that they imply.
The global stakes are thus very high this spring as the Bank’s 187 member countries choose a new president to succeed Robert Zoellick, whose term ends in July.
The World Bank was established in 1944 to promote economic development, and virtually every country is now a member.
Its central mission is to reduce global poverty and ensure that global development is environmentally sound and socially inclusive.
Achieving these goals would not only improve the lives of billions of people, but would also forestall violent conflicts that are stoked by poverty, famine, and struggles over scarce resources.
American officials have traditionally viewed the World Bank as an extension of United States foreign policy and commercial interests.
With the Bank just two blocks away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, it has been all too easy for the US to dominate the institution.
Now many members, including Brazil, China, India, and several African countries, are raising their voices in support of more collegial leadership and an improved strategy that works for all.
From the Bank’s establishment until today, the unwritten rule has been that the US government simply designates each new president: all 11 have been Americans, and not a single one has been an expert in economic development, the Bank’s core responsibility, or had a career in fighting poverty or promoting environmental sustainability.
Instead, the US has selected Wall Street bankers and politicians, presumably to ensure that the Bank’s policies are suitably friendly to US commercial and political interests.
Yet the policy is backfiring on the US and badly hurting the world.
Because of a long-standing lack of strategic expertise at the top, the Bank has lacked a clear direction.
Many projects have catered to US corporate interests rather than to sustainable development.
The Bank has cut a lot of ribbons on development projects, but has solved far too few global problems.
For too long, the Bank’s leadership has imposed US concepts that are often utterly inappropriate for the poorest countries and their poorest people.
For example, the Bank completely fumbled the exploding pandemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria during the 1990’s, failing to get help to where it was needed to curb these outbreaks and save millions of lives.
Even worse, the Bank advocated user fees and “cost recovery” for health services, thereby putting life-saving health care beyond the reach of the poorest of the poor – precisely those most in need of it.
In 2000, at the Durban AIDS Summit, I recommended a new “Global Fund” to fight these diseases, precisely on the grounds that the World Bank was not doing its job.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria emerged, and has since saved millions of lives, with malaria deaths in Africa alone falling by at least 30%.
The Bank similarly missed crucial opportunities to support smallholder subsistence farmers and to promote integrated rural development more generally in impoverished rural communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
For around 20 years, roughly from 1985 to 2005, the Bank resisted the well-proven use of targeted support for small landholders to enable impoverished subsistence farmers to improve yields and break out of poverty.
More recently, the Bank has increased its support for smallholders, but there is still far more that it can and should do.
The Bank’s staff is highly professional, and would accomplish much more if freed from the dominance of narrow US interests and viewpoints.
The Bank has the potential to be a catalyst of progress in key areas that will shape the world’s future.
Its priorities should include agricultural productivity; mobilization of information technologies for sustainable development; deployment of low-carbon energy systems; and quality education for all, with greater reliance on new forms of communication to reach hundreds of millions of under-served students.
The Bank’s activities currently touch on all of these areas, but it fails to lead effectively on any of them.
Despite the excellence of its staff, the Bank has not been strategic or agile enough to be an effective agent of change.
Getting the Bank’s role right will be hard work, requiring expertise at the top.
Most importantly, the Bank’s new president should have first-hand professional experience regarding the range of pressing development challenges.
The world should not accept the status quo.
A World Bank leader who once again comes from Wall Street or from US politics would be a heavy blow for a planet in need of creative solutions to complex development challenges.
The Bank needs an accomplished professional who is ready to tackle the great challenges of sustainable development from day one.&nbsp;
A World of Convergence
WASHINGTON, DC – For almost two centuries, starting around 1800, the history of the global economy was broadly one of divergence in average incomes.
In relative terms, rich countries got even richer.
There was growth in the poorer countries, too, but it was slower than rich-country growth, and the discrepancy in prosperity between rich and poor countries increased.
This “divergence” was very pronounced in colonial times.
It slowed after the 1940’s, but it was only around 1990 that an entirely new trend could be observed – convergence between average incomes in the group of rich countries and the rest of the world.
From 1990 to 2010, average per capita income in the emerging and developing countries grew almost three times as fast as average income in Europe, North America, and Japan, compared to lower or, at most, equal growth rates for almost two centuries.
This has been a revolutionary change, but will this 20-year-old trend continue?
Will convergence remain rapid, or will it be a passing phase in world economic history?
Long-term projections based on short-term trends have often been mistaken.
In the late 1950’s, after the Soviet Union launched the first spacecraft, eminent Western economists predicted that Soviet income would overtake that of the United States in a few decades.
After all, the Soviet Union was investing close to 40% of its GDP, twice the ratio in the West.
Later, in the 1980’s, Japan’s spectacular growth led some to predict that it would overtake the US, not only in per capita terms, but even in terms of some measures of “economic power.”
These kinds of projections have often been based on simple extrapolations of exponential trends.
Over two or three decades, substantial differences in compound growth rates quickly generate huge changes in economic size or per capita income.
Will the recent predictions of rapid ongoing global convergence similarly turn out to be wrong, or will most of the emerging countries sustain a large positive growth differential and get much closer to the advanced economies’ income levels?
Understanding the phenomenon of “catch-up” growth is key to answering this question.
Trade and foreign direct investment have made it much easier for emerging countries to absorb and adapt best-practice technology invented in the advanced economies.
The information revolution, allowing much easier access to and diffusion of knowledge, has accelerated the process.
Once they developed the basic institutions needed for a market economy and learned how to avoid serious macroeconomic policy mistakes, emerging countries started benefiting from catch-up growth.
Those with very high investment rates, mostly in East Asia, grew faster than those with lower investment rates; but, overall, catch-up growth probably has been adding 2-4 percentage points to many emerging and developing countries’ annual growth rates.
At the same time, population growth decreased, adding at least another point to the pace of per capita growth.
This process will likely continue for another decade or two, depending on where in the process particular countries are.
It is true that catch-up growth is easier in manufacturing than in other sectors, a point recently emphasized by Dani Rodrik of Harvard University, and it may be that a good portion of it has been exhausted in manufacturing by the best-performing firms in emerging countries.
But there is still a lot of “internal” room for catch-up growth, as less efficient domestic firms become more competitive with more efficient ones.
The dispersion of “total factor productivity” – the joint productivity of capital and labor – inside emerging countries has been found to be large.
Moreover, sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, and trade also have catch-up-growth potential, through imports of technology, institutional know-how, and organizational models.
Of course, temporary disturbances, a worsening of global payments imbalances, or macroeconomic policy mistakes, including those made in advanced economies and affecting the entire world economy, could undermine global growth.
But the underlying “convergence differential,” owing to catch-up growth, is likely to continue to reduce the income gap between the old advanced economies and emerging-market countries.
The Soviet Union never was able to build the institutions to allow for catch-up economic growth.
Japan slowed down after it had basically caught up.
China, India, Brazil, Turkey, and others may have firms operating close to the world’s technological frontier, but they still have a lot of unused catch-up potential.
The more that these countries can invest while ensuring macroeconomic stability and balance-of-payments sustainability, the faster they can adopt better technology and production processes.
In that case, they can continue to catch up, at least for the next decade or more.
The convergence process is going to slow, but not yet.
A World of Gray
CANBERRA – Václav Havel, the Czech playwright and dissident turned president, and North Korean despot Kim Jong-il might have lived on different planets, for all their common commitment to human dignity, rights, and democracy.
When they died just a day apart this month, the contrast was hard for the global commentariat to resist: Prague’s prince of light against Pyongyang’s prince of darkness.
But it is worth remembering that Manichaean good-versus-evil typecasting, to which former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair were famously prone, and of which we have had something of a resurgence in recent days, carries with it two big risks for international policymakers.
One risk is that such thinking limits the options for dealing effectively with those who are cast as irredeemably evil.
The debacle of the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 should have taught us once and for all the peril of talking only through the barrel of a gun to those whose behavior disgusts us.
Sometimes, threats to a civilian population will be so acute and immediate as to make coercive military intervention the only option, as with Muammar el-Qaddafi’s Libya, at least at the time of the imminent assault on Benghazi in March.
But more often it will be a matter of relying on less extreme measures, like targeted sanctions and threats of international prosecution – and on diplomatic pressure and persuasion.
Negotiating with the genocidal butchers of the Khmer Rouge was acutely troubling, personally and politically, for those of us involved, but those talks secured a lasting peace in Cambodia.
And it is only negotiation – albeit backed by good old-fashioned containment and deterrence – that can possibly deliver sustainable peace with Iran and North Korea.
The second risk that arises from seeing the world in black-and-white terms is greater public cynicism, thereby making ideals-based policymaking in the future even harder.
Expectations raised too high are expectations bound to be disappointed: think of former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook’s “ethical foreign policy” at the start of Blair’s premiership.
Political leaders who make a big play of “values” are often those most likely to stumble.
Think of the lamentable response by US President Bill Clinton’s administration to the Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Australia’s shameful rejection of asylum-seeking boat people in the Tampa affair under John Howard’s government a decade ago.
Then there is many Western governments’ highly selective embrace of democracy when it results in the election of those (like Hamas) whom they find unacceptable; the unwillingness of almost every nuclear-weapons state to match its disarmament rhetoric with credible action; and the almost universal double-talk on climate change.
But if double talk were an indictable offense, there would be few left to attend international summits.
The task is neither to pillory nor to sanctify political leaders caught in these traps, but somehow to reconcile what they will often see as hopelessly competing demands of moral values and national interests, and to find ways to get them to do more good and less harm.
A useful way forward in this respect may be to rethink fundamentally the concept of “national interest.”
Traditionally seen as having just two dimensions – economic and geostrategic – there is a strong case for adding a third: every country’s interest in being, and being seen to be, a good international citizen.
Actively helping to solve global public-goods challenges (like climate change, human-rights protection, international piracy, drug trafficking, cross-border population flows, and elimination of weapons of mass destruction), even when there is no direct economic or strategic payoff, is not simply the foreign policy equivalent of Boy Scout good deeds.
Selfless cooperation on these issues can actually work to a country’s advantage by boosting its reputation and generating reciprocal support: my help in solving your drug-trafficking problem today will increase the chances of you supporting my asylum-seeker problem tomorrow.
And a story couched in these realist terms is likely to be easier to sell to domestic constituencies than one pitched as disinterested altruism.
Countries should pursue what the great international-relations scholar Hedley Bull called “purposes beyond ourselves”: our common humanity demands no less.
But the real world is a place of gray shades, not black and white, and more often than not the cause of human decency and security will be better served by recognizing and working around that constraint rather than challenging it head on.
A World of Multiple Reserve Currencies
BERKELEY – The competition for reserve-currency status is conventionally portrayed as a winner-take-all game.
There is room, in this view, for just one full-fledged international currency.
The only question is which national currency will capture the role.
Market logic, it is argued, dictates this result.
For importers and exporters, quoting prices in the same currency – say, the dollar – as other importers and exporters avoids confusing one’s customers.
For central banks, holding reserves in the same currency as other central banks means holding the most liquid asset.
With everyone else buying, selling, and holding dollars, it pays to do the same, since markets in dollar-denominated assets will be the deepest.
While it is always possible that there could come a tipping point at which everyone migrates from one currency to another, the network-based nature of the international monetary system, it is said, leaves room for only one true international unit.
But this premise is wrong, for three reasons.
First, the notion that importers, exporters, and bond underwriters will want to use the same unit as other importers, exporters, and bond underwriters holds less weight in a world where everyone has a mobile phone that can compare currency values in real time.
Once upon a time, comparing prices in dollars and euros might have been beyond the capacity of all but the most sophisticated traders and investors.
Nowadays, “Currency Converter” is one of the Apple app store’s top ten downloads.
Second, the sheer size of today’s global economy means that there is now room for deep and liquid markets in more than one currency.
Finally, the view that there can be just one international and reserve currency at any point in time is inconsistent with history.
Before 1914, there were three international currencies: the British pound, the French franc, and the German mark.
The dollar and the pound then shared international primacy in the 1920’s and 1930’s.
Today, currencies other than the dollar account for 40% of identified international reserves.
The implication is that the dollar, the euro, and the renminbi will share the roles of invoicing currency, settlement currency, and reserve currency in coming years.
To be sure, all three currencies have their critics.
Willingness to hold the dollar may be undercut by concern with America’s twin fiscal and external deficits.
Uncertainty about whether the European Union will hold together could limit the use of the euro.
And, although China is aggressively promoting international use of the renminbi in trade settlements, it has a long way to go before its currency is attractive as a vehicle for foreign investment and holding reserves.
But the very fact that there are questions about all three currencies means that none of them will obviously dominate.
There will be an international market for all three.
Some worry about the stability of this world of multiple international currencies.
They shouldn’t: a more decentralized international monetary system is precisely what is needed to prevent a replay of the financial crisis.
Countries seeking additional reserves will not be forced to accumulate only – or even mainly – dollars.
No one country will be able to run current-account deficits and use foreign finance to indulge in financial excesses as freely as the United States did in recent years.
This will make the world a safer place financially.
Will exchange rates between the major currencies be dangerously unstable?
Will those responsible for managing central-bank reserves, seeking to maximize returns, shift erratically between those currencies?
The fear underlying such questions rests on a misunderstanding of the behavior of central-banks reserve managers.
Reserve managers do not have the high-powered financial incentives of hedge fund managers to seek to maximize returns.
They do not have to exceed their previous high-water mark in order to draw a paycheck.
They have social responsibilities, and they know it.
This means that they have less incentive to herd – to buy or sell a currency just because everyone else is buying or selling it.
They can adopt a longer time horizon, because, unlike private fund managers, they do not have to satisfy impatient investors.
Compared to private investors, then, central-bank reserve managers are more likely to act as stabilizing speculators. The result will be to make the exchange rates between the three international currencies more stable, not less.
The world economy of the twenty-first century is becoming more multipolar.
There is no reason why the same should not be true of its international monetary system.
In the end, that will be a good thing.
A World of Regions
NEW YORK – In almost every part of the world, long-festering problems can be solved through closer cooperation among neighboring countries.
The European Union provides the best model for how neighbors that have long fought each other can come together for mutual benefit.
Ironically, today’s decline in American global power may lead to more effective regional cooperation.
This may seem an odd time to praise the EU, given the economic crises in Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland.
Europe has not solved the problem of balancing the interests of strong economies in the North and those of weaker economies in the South.
Still, the EU’s accomplishments vastly outweigh its current difficulties.
The EU has created a zone of peace where once there was relentless war.
It has provided the institutional framework for reuniting Western and Eastern Europe.
It has fostered regional-scale infrastructure.
The single market has been crucial to making Europe one of the most prosperous places on the planet.
And the EU has been a global leader on environmental sustainability.
For these reasons, the EU provides a unique model for other regions that remain stuck in a mire of conflict, poverty, lack of infrastructure, and environmental crisis.
New regional organizations, such as the African Union, look to the EU as a role model for regional problem-solving and integration.
Yet, to this day, most regional groupings remain too weak to solve their members’ pressing problems.
In most other regions, ongoing political divisions have their roots in the Cold War or the colonial era.
During the Cold War, neighbors often competed with each other by “choosing sides” – allying themselves with either the United States or the Soviet Union.  Pakistan tilted towards the Americans; India towards the Soviets.
Countries had little incentive to make peace with their neighbors as long as they enjoyed the financial support of the US or the USSR.
On the contrary, continued conflict often led directly to more financial aid.
Indeed, the US and Europe often acted to undermine regional integration, which they believed would limit their roles as power brokers.
Thus, when Gamal Abdel Nasser launched a call for Arab unity in the 1950’s, the US and Europe viewed him as a threat.  The US undercut his call for strong Arab cooperation and nationalism, fearing a loss of American influence in the Middle East.
As a result, Nasser increasingly aligned Egypt with the Soviet Union, and ultimately failed in the quest to unite Arab interests.
Today’s reality, however, is that great powers can no longer divide and conquer other regions, even if they try.
The age of colonialism is finished, and we are now moving beyond the age of US global dominance.
Recent events in the Middle East and Central Asia, for example, clearly reflect the decline of US influence.
America’s failure to win any lasting geopolitical advantage through the use of military force in Iraq and Afghanistan underscore the limits of its power, while its budget crisis ensures that it will cut its military resources sooner rather than later.
Similarly, the US played no role in the political revolutions underway in the Arab world, and still has not demonstrated any clear policy response to them.
President Barack Obama’s recent speech on the Middle East is a further display of America’s declining influence in the region.
The speech drew the most attention for calling on Israel to return to its 1967 borders, but the effect was undercut when Israel flatly rejected the US position.
The world could see that there would be little practical follow-up.
The rest of the speech was even more revealing, though it drew little public notice.
When Obama discussed the Arab political upheavals, he noted the importance of economic development.
Yet when it came to US action, the most that the US could offer financially was slight debt relief for Egypt ($1 billion), scant loan guarantees ($1 billion), and some insurance coverage for private investments.
The real message was that the US government would contribute very little financially to the region’s economic recovery.
The days when a country could depend on large-scale American financing are over.
We are, in short, moving to a multi-polar world.
The Cold War’s end has not led to greater US dominance, but rather to the dissemination of global power to many regions.  East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East have new geopolitical and economic influence.
Each region, increasingly, must find its own path to economic development, energy and food security, and effective infrastructure, and must do so in a world threatened by climate change and resource scarcity.
Each region, therefore, will have to secure its own future.
Of course, this should occur in a context of cooperation across regions as well as within them.
The Middle East is in a strong position to help itself.
There is a high degree of economic complementarity between Egypt and the oil-rich Gulf States.
Egypt can supply technology, manpower, and considerable expertise for the Arab region, while the Gulf provides energy and finance, as well as some specialists.
The long-delayed vision of Arab economic unity should be returned to the table.
Israel, too, should recognize that its long-term security and prosperity will be enhanced as part of an economically stronger region.
For the sake of its own national interests, Israel must come to terms with its neighbors.
Other regions also will find that the decline of US power increases the urgency of stronger cooperation between neighbors.
Some of the greatest tensions in the world – say India and Pakistan, or North and South Korea – should be defused as part of region-wide strengthening.
As the EU shows, ancient enmities and battle lines can be turned into mutually beneficial cooperation if a region looks forward, to resolving its long-term needs, rather than backward, to its long-standing rivalries and conflicts.
A World Restored?
BERLIN: Like old battle horses feeling young as the bugle sounds, Cold War strategists are feeling the adrenalin mount as missile defense becomes front page news.
True, the defense against missiles which Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) are proposing – with massive support from America’s Congress – is different from Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars dream of twenty years ago: NMD is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads, not provide complete protection against enemy missiles.
Nevertheless, the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance.
Amazingly, debate is heating up even though it is uncertain that NMD will work.
Even if it does work, it will be ten to fifteen years, possibly longer, before NMD is operational.
So tempers are rising over something which, if and when it happens in the distant future, may or may not have much impact.
Normally cautious governments are positioning themselves now as if the future were around the corner.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });What explains this odd behavior?
Not blind faith in technology.
After all, the history of missile defense is a tale of technology constantly disappointing its advocates in and out of government.
No one in his right mind can assume that something never achieved before, namely destroying a small number of warheads in flight, will happen over night.
Of the three tests so far conducted, one failed almost, two entirely, which is why President Clinton left the matter to his successor.
If President Bush, as he has hinted, now favors a different design, it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program.
Nobody can be sure that it will work either.
Governments are worried now, not because of capabilities, but because of America’s real or imagined intentions.
While Americans claim that NMD is not directed against anyone, that all the US wants is to protect its citizens against states like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone else thinks differently: Russians fear that America wants to cement its military superiority (and Russia's inferiority) forever; the Chinese are concerned that NMD signals American readiness to help Taiwan remain independent; Europeans worry that America's plans invite tensions with Russia and may separate the US from Europe.
Because political intentions, not technical capabilities matter, NMD creates problems now: it pushes Russia into confrontation, heightens Chinese nervousness, and underpins a European sense of estrangement from the US.
Damage is done from the word go while the end of the road remains obscured.
Inflating this political damage is the fact that, thirty years ago, the US and the then Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles.
Normally, a US defense project in its infancy would not cause the excitement NMD generates.
But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits, for the indefinite future, systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack.
As the US proceeds with NMD, it will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to quit, something both signatories are entitled to do if they feel their vital security interests demand it.
In the eyes of many, that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War.
The Bush Administration argues that, because the Cold War is over, the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not mean a loss of nuclear stability.
But stability is as much a matter of political perceptions as of technical calculations.
By limiting strategic missile defense, the old treaty provides a certain predictability of deterrence for all nuclear weapon states.
Its disappearance would affect all other arms control agreements.
Russia threatens to scrap all of them once the US leaves the ABM-Treaty.
While this threat lacks credibility (it would harm Russian interests most) it has a certain logic.
The main question NMD poses is not how to prepare for a future world of missile defense but how to dampen today’s political concerns.
Such efforts are getting discretely underway.
Legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for building missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM-Treaty and so do not yet require a US notice to quit.
For now, the Bush Administration will await the outcome of tests before deciding.
Both Moscow and Washington hint at possible deep cuts in their offensive nuclear arsenals.
Skeptical European allies are being mollified by US assurances of close consultation.
The most important of confidence-building measures, a modification of the ABM-Treaty to allow for limited missile defense, is being explored.
Russia’s early "nyet" may not be the last word.
So political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed.
But what about China?
In contrast to Europe and Russia, China is not party to an alliance (as is Europe) or to a network of arms control treaties through which political solutions can evolve (like Russia), factors that contribute to Asian instabilities and Chinese sensitivity.
Here confidence can only be built through the approach taken by the US to China.
Regrettably, there are no indications yet that the problem is recognized in Washington as a serious one.
All this comes as a disappointment to old Cold War strategists.
While brushing up the vocabulary and abbreviations of the age of superpower deterrence, they discover that such a world has gone.
Missile defense is not a threat to US-Russian strategic stability; its mishandling is a threat to political predictability.
By announcing its determination to go ahead with a distant NMD, the US has created political turbulence which it must address now if major damage is to be avoided.
A Year of Anniversaries and Uncertainties
ALBERTA – As China enters the “Year of the Ox,” there is much to reflect on from the past 12 months and even more to speculate about regarding the coming year.
2008 began with devastating snowstorms that paralyzed most of central and southern China’s transport system, interrupting lives and causing severe material damage.
Then came the riots in Tibet, which caught the government off guard, followed by embarrassing protests over China’s Olympic torch relay in several Western and Asian countries.
Then, as Chinese were wondering why 2008, a year of supposed good fortune marked by the lucky number eight, had started with so much misfortune, a deadly earthquake struck Sichuan province, killing 80,000 people and leaving millions homeless.
Emerging more united from this tragedy, the country welcomed the world to the long-anticipated Olympics, which were remarkably successful, but were soon superseded by the tainted-dairy-product scandal in which many babies became ill, and some died.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });In contrast to last year, when the rush home for the lunar New Year celebration was hampered by freak storms, this year millions of migrant workers have already returned to their rural homes.
Many will be staying there, because the global economic downturn has hit China hard, costing them their jobs.
Littered with a host of extremely sensitive anniversaries, 2009 could prove even more dramatic and unpredictable than 2008.
Fast approaching is not only the March anniversary of last year’s disturbances in Tibet, but also the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan unrest in 1959 that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama and his supporters.
Since the riots last spring, China’s government has taken many pro-active measures, even adopting a “Serf Liberation Day,” to defend its record in Tibet of the past 50 years, while continuing to talk with the Dalai Lama’s representatives.
But it has also implemented heavy-handed police and military controls.
Then comes the 20th anniversary of the June 4 crackdown on the Tiananmen Square student demonstrations.
Calls to re-evaluate the official response began when President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao came to power seven years ago.
But recently the pressure has intensified, especially with the publication of “Charter 08,” a manifesto signed by hundreds of Chinese intellectuals, journalists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens, condemning the government’s human rights record and demanding more democratic reform, press freedom, governmental transparency, and societal openness.
Although neither Hu nor Wen were directly involved in the crackdown, they nonetheless must tread carefully.
Doing everything possible to avoid a repeat of the 1989 scenario may well be the Communist Party leadership’s top priority in 2009.
And, given the economic slowdown, widening income disparity, rising unemployment, and growing popular discontent over corruption, China’s leaders will have their hands full.
Of course, the inspiration for almost every political reform movement in China is the May 4th Movement of 1919, when Chinese students protested against a weak and corrupt government and called for China to strengthen itself by adopting two key Western ideals: democracy and science.
As the 90th anniversary approaches, China has made great strides in science, but still has a long way to go in terms of democracy.
This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the Great Leap Forward, when 20-40 million Chinese died of starvation, as well as the tenth anniversary of the government’s ban on Falun gong, an organization of self-claimed religious and meditation practitioners that has challenged the Communist Party’s legitimacy.
Though largely discredited inside the country, this militant movement still has a following around the world, and further protests may come at any time and in unpredictable forms.
While some of the plethora of anniversaries that China’s leaders must confront are potentially very destabilizing, several have, and will, work in their favor.
For example, the 30th anniversary of China’s reform movement and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States has been a much-celebrated event this January.
More importantly, October will mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples’ Republic of China, an occasion that the Party will commemorate in grand style.
After all, the Middle Kingdom has re-emerged as the world’s third-largest economy (having recently replaced Germany), sent astronauts into space, dispatched advanced naval destroyers to the Horn of Africa, and become the largest holder of US foreign debt.
China will want to flex its muscles and proclaim to the world that the Party has delivered the goods to its people, while making the country strong and prosperous.
As the worst recession since the1930’s continues, both the American and Chinese economies are bound to suffer further setbacks.
There is no guarantee that protectionist and xenophobic sentiment in America will not hit China-US relations, or that the economic downturn will not fuel new unrest in China.
The world should not misjudge the effect of such troubles on China.
Nor should it forget China’s fierce display of nationalism in response to Western protests of the Olympic touch relay, the extraordinary patriotism that swept the country in response to the Sichuan earthquake, and the national pride evinced by the Olympic Games.
But, in 2009, it would not hurt if China’s leadership also took note of the need to continue assuring the world of its commitment to a “peaceful rise,” and to do so by boldly addressing some of the unresolved issues that this year’s anniversaries will highlight.
A Year of US-China Discord?
NEW YORK – In 2009,Forbes magazine named US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao the “world’s most powerful people.”
In 2010, we will discover that neither has the power to keep US-Chinese relations on track.
That is bad news for those who believe that US-China cooperation is essential for reviving the global economy, meeting the challenge of climate change, containing threats of nuclear proliferation, and managing a host of other problems without borders.
It is also bad news for America and China.
Ten is the number to watch: America's 10% unemployment and China’s potential 10% GDP growth are set to collide like weather fronts generating a storm.
American populism will meet Chinese pride.
And the fevered political climate created by US mid-term elections means that the world’s most important bilateral relationship is headed for real turbulence this year.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });America and China now live with a kind of mutually assured economic destruction, and both presidents know it.
The US needs China to finance its mounting debt, and China needs Americans to buy its products.
Indeed, the short, sharp shock that China absorbed from the financial crisis has proven that its economic growth still depends on consumer demand in America, Europe, and Japan – and will for some time to come.
Chinese leaders would like to shift China’s growth model toward greater reliance on domestic consumption, but that is a long-term project.
For the foreseeable future, they will depend on local manufacturers to create the jobs that protect both China’s development goals and the Communist Party’s monopoly on domestic political power.
Fear of shuttered factories and lost wages pushed China’s government last year to launch a massive stimulus program to protect jobs and restore growth.
It worked.
China, with much less exposure than the West to toxic banking assets, is off to the races again as America struggles to its feet.
In a recent Pew Poll, 44% of US respondents named China as “the world’s leading economic power.”
Just 27% chose America.
To be sure, an eventual US recovery is inevitable, but job growth usually takes longer to recover.
As long as voters are worried about their wallets, Democrats and Republicans will compete to defend American workers.
As November’s elections approach, many US lawmakers will demand that the country with 10% unemployment persuade the country with 10% growth to stop bending trade rules and manipulating the value of its currency.
China’s leadership, for its part, will want to know why free-market champions in Washington are threatening more protectionism.
For, as China’s growth accelerates, trade imbalances heighten US frustrations, and elections loom, lawmakers of both US political parties will threaten punitive action against China on a variety of subjects.
The Obama administration has already moved against Chinese exports of tires and steel pipes, but this year’s confrontation will extend well beyond trade.
When Congress takes up the debate over climate change, for example, and some lawmakers call for a cap-and-trade system, others will demand to know why America should accept binding commitments to limit emissions while the Chinese refuse.
China’s leaders, in no mood to play the scapegoat, will use surging national pride to bolster their position and strengthen their hand in negotiations.
The Chinese government has invested heavily in recent years in state-owned companies and privately-owned “national champions,” mainly to ensure that China profits from the power of markets while the leadership controls as much of the spoils as possible.
To help these domestic powerhouses increase their market leverage, the government often favors them at the expense of foreign competitors.
Hostile US rhetoric and trade action will give China’s leaders an excuse to accelerate this trend.
The Obama administration also wants China to share more of the burdens of international leadership.
This includes helping the US to apply pressure on countries like Iran, Sudan, and Myanmar that continue to defy the will of the international community – and with which those Chinese state-owned companies have established lucrative commercial relationships that serve the Chinese government’s economic and political interests.
China’s leaders, unwilling to compromise on any issue that might undermine their domestic goals, continue to resist.
A full-scale trade war is unlikely.
Both governments know the stakes are too high for both economies, and Obama and Hu will continue to work hard to try to keep things moving in a constructive direction.
But neither president can guarantee that recrimination and reproach will not take on a life of its own.
For example, if another product-safety issue involving Chinese imports makes headlines in the US, things could move quickly from disappointment to real anger.
Most Americans care little about China's currency policy or its stance on intellectual property rights.
But if Chinese-made products threaten their health and safety, there are sure to be opportunistic lawmakers ready to fan the flames.
The 2008 US presidential election was the last in which the overwhelming majority of American voters neither knew nor cared about where the candidates stood on China.
Officials in Beijing, increasingly sensitive to US criticism, will prove as ready to trade accusations as goods and services or good ideas.
That is why the “world’s most powerful people” will now have a much harder time working together to meet today’s toughest challenges.
A Yukos Autopsy
Yukos, once Russia’s leading oil company and a favorite of international investors, is in its death throes.
At what many perceived to be a rigged auction, the company’s best assets were sold off to a previously unknown bidder and are now back in the hands of the Russian state.
The shell of what remains continues to challenge the company’s fate, notably in a Houston, Texas courtroom.
But these spasms will not revive the corpse.
What matters now is whether Russia’s economy will share Yukos’s fate.
The damage to Russia’s economic growth prospects from the Yukos affair may yet prove temporary, barring a repeat performance with other companies.
But whether the Yukos affair proves to be an isolated case, as the Kremlin insists, depends on a reading of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motives.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });One possibility is that Putin is not sincere about his aim of doubling Russia’s GDP in a decade.
Recent opinion polls suggest that this is the view of much of Russia’s cynical public.
On this view, the privatizations of the 1990’s were a scam serving only the powers that be.
But any reversal of those privatizations – such as the effective expropriation of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his Menatep partners in Yukos – signifies not the dawn of social justice but rather a new group of bosses “expropriating the expropriators,” as Lenin used to say.
A less nihilistic view is that the Yukos affair suggests above all a series of improvisations by Putin rather than a coherent agenda.
This is somewhat reassuring.
Much evidence points to the affair originating not in a systematic nationalization project, but rather in the Kremlin’s perception that Khodorkovsky aimed to use his wealth to privatize the Russian state itself.
Such “state capture” occurred in Russia in the late 1990’s and to an even greater extent under the Kuchma regime in neighboring Ukraine which, ironically, Putin tried to preserve.
Neutralizing the perceived threat from Khodorkovsky meant depriving him of the means to achieve his ambitions by separating his Menatep Group from Yukos’s future cash flows.
The massive tax claims against Yukos used for this purpose were precisely that – the means rather than the end.
Had the goal been mere recovery of tax arrears, there would have been no need to break up the company: Yukos could have settled even these colossal liabilities on a civilized installment schedule.
To be sure, expropriating Menatep made shares in Yukos – a company that by 2003 attracted more domestic and foreign savings than any other in Russia – virtually worthless.
But this seems like collateral damage from the pursuit of an overriding political objective.
Much now depends on whether the same is true of the other major outcome, which is that Yukos’s principal asset – Yuganskneftegaz – is now in state hands, while its remaining units appear doomed to nationalization.
Is this another incidental by-product of the campaign against Khodorkovsky, or is it part of the core Kremlin agenda?
Nationalization certainly seems to appeal to the powerful faction comprising Putin’s former KGB colleagues and associates from his native St. Petersburg, one of whom last year became the chairman of Rosneft, the wholly state-owned oil company which acquired Yuganskneftegaz.
But if the influence of these so-calledsiloviki was unbridled, similar attacks would have been launched against other major companies by now.
As it is, even Roman Abramovich’s Sibneft – potentially the most vulnerable company due to its oligarch ownership and its use of the same tax minimization schemes that were the undoing of Yukos – merely faces a preliminary claim for back taxes.
In contrast to Yukos, the claim does not exceed the company’s cash on hand and so poses no threat to its existence.
Even the nationalization of Yukos’s assets may reflect little more than the absence of alternative buyers, given the obvious political obstacle passing those assets on to other domestic private-sector players (i.e., oligarchs), and the legal and reputational barriers to foreign investors.
So the interpretation that best fits the facts so far is that the political aim of separating Khodorkovsky and Menatep from Yukos led in practice to nationalization, but that this was not the underlying goal.
There is no green light for opportunistic predators in and around the Kremlin who now control Yuganskneftegaz to grab other companies’ assets at will.
If so, the damage caused by the Yukos affair should be minimal.
Yet, even on the assumption that Putin has no plans to nationalize key natural resource companies, he clearly desires strong state control over these “commanding heights” of the economy.
That in itself will result in overall GDP growth falling below potential, owing to the inferior productivity and greater corruption in the major companies that the state controls or heavily influences.
In a speech marking the state gas monopoly Gazprom’s tenth anniversary in 2003, Putin stated his position explicitly, speaking of the company as one of the few strong geopolitical levers left to Russia after the Soviet collapse.
Putin’s geopolitical preoccupations could be accommodated by sensibly preserving state ownership of pipeline infrastructure in the hydrocarbons sector, while allowing private companies to extract, process, and sell Russia’s oil and gas.
Instead, Putin has allowed Gazprom’s management to block proposals from his own government on the long overdue unbundling of the company.
Putin has sought an economic transformation of Russia similar in kind, if not in degree, to China’s boom.
The prize is higher living standards for Russia’s long-suffering people and a recovery in the country’s international standing.
Despite uncertainty about Putin’s intentions, that prize is not out of reach.
Indeed, at this point the only action more harmful than the Yukos affair would be another Yukos affair.
Abandoning Asia’s Poor
NEW YORK &#45;&#45; More than half of Asia’s population &#45;&#45; 1.8 billion people &#45;&#45; live on less than $2 a day; more than 600 million of them try to survive on less than $1 a day.
With food prices now soaring, most of Asia’s “working poor,” who are already struggling on degraded lands, in sweatshops, on streets and at homes, risk further destitution.
Yet the Asian Development Bank – an institution whose mission is to reduce poverty – last month approved a new corporate strategy (ADB Long Term Strategic Framework 2008-2020) that is ominously silent on the importance of employment and social protection for the poor.
A handful of influential ADB bureaucrats with large salaries, secured pensions, comprehensive health insurance, subsidized housing, and education for their children, have apparently decided that financing subsidized housing, health, nutrition, and child protection programs is not a priority.
Nor do they consider land reform, employment services, or pensions for all Asians a priority.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Instead, these officials have decided to refocus ADB operations on three areas: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration, with a heavy emphasis on private-sector development.
The ADB is abandoning crucial public support for social development.
The new strategy is a reversal of the policies of the late 1990’s, when the ADB changed its objective from “economic growth” to “poverty reduction.”
The ADB’s earlier policies were based on broad-based growth, good governance, and social development.
Ten years later, only an empty corporate motto of “an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty” is left.
Social protection, housing, employment, and labor are not on the ADB’s new agenda.
Health and agriculture will be considered only on a highly selective basis.
Only education remains as a future investment sector, given its impact on productivity, but the rest of the much-needed social sector interventions have been abandoned in favor of investment in infrastructure, the environment, regional integration, and finance.
No lesson was learned from the Asian financial crisis, which underscored the importance of social protection.
Pensions are mentioned only under financial-sector development: the ADB is to promote private-led insurance, despite evidence from the United Nations, International Labor Organization, World Bank and NGOs showing that private pensions do not reach the poor.
If the ADB were serious about poverty reduction, it would put a significant share of its investments in social development, particularly on non-contributory universal social security schemes that can reduce poverty by 35% to 50%.
Why is the ADB constricting its agenda?
Why does it want to deny governments’ access to much-needed funds for social development?
The ADB argues that other agencies are responsible for social development.
But that argument is unjustified: while institutions such as the UN and NGOs may work on social development, they are under-funded compared to the ADB.
Besides, plenty of other public and private institutions undertake the infrastructure and finance projects that the ADB now wants to focus on.
So, what is the ADB’s added value, and whom does it serve?
Certainly the ADB’s new strategy will not serve the majority of Asians, 60% of whom still live in poor rural areas.
Indeed, Asia and the Pacific account for three-quarters of the world's stunted, underweight, and malnourished children.
Maternal mortality rates remain dismal in several countries.
As food prices rise, so is hunger and poverty.
External and internal pressure at the ADB’s Annual Meeting this May forced the bank to respond to the current food crisis through temporary safety-net food security programs.
It also offered medium-term measures such as infrastructure and rural finance.
All of these are good, but they are insufficient.
Other measures are needed to reduce poverty in rural areas, such as land reform and rights, agricultural extension services, expanding access to health and non-contributory social pensions, just to mention some.
ADB’s major goal, however, seems to be to scale up private-sector support from 15% to 50% of total bank operations.
Several countries have expressed reservations about this.
It will include direct financing, credit enhancements, and guarantees – a subsidy to a sector known for its risky non-performing operations at the ADB – as well as business-friendly regulations and removal of market “barriers,” which include social and labor rights.
Such rights can be tolerated only as minimum social safeguards, which the ADB is trying to neuter through another ongoing review.
Unless the ADB’s member governments reverse its current policies, they, too, will be blamed for ignoring the urgent needs of the poor.
Poverty reduction requires both economic and social policies that reach people.
Growth on its own is not sufficient to guarantee poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.
Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel
For almost two generations, Abba Eban was Israel's voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world.
Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940's during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty, few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction.
With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II.
As Ambassador to the United States and the UN, and later as Foreign Minister, he represented an Israel with which the world's liberal imagination could identify.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman, and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands.
His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity.
His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion.
Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him.
He was a true patriot, in the old-fashioned sense of the word: proud of his people, but never ethno-centric; a man of the world, but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people, but never losing the universal horizon of mankind.
In short, he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word.
It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages, all of them in Yiddish.
Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages, and all of them with an Oxford/Cambridge accent.
Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics.
Perhaps Eban was too urbane, too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli's phrase - to the top of the greasy pole.
Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War.
He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973, yet it nonetheless brought him down as well.
He never found his way back, and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism, he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style.
In the international arena, Eban's pen was his sword, and the spoken word his lance.
He was less adept in political infighting in Israel.
He could be a fierce turf fighter, yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served.
It is far from clear if he would have prevailed, given his lack of an independent political base, but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet.
He never did.
Eban's silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health.
At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists, the moral certitudes of Eban, for all their urbanity, may sound shallow.
But nation-building requires moral stamina, and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance.
Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years, I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01, and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding.
Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state.
As an Arabist by training, immersed in Arab and Muslim culture, he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism.
This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab.
That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban's greatest disappointment.
Despite the high-born image Eban projected, he was an extremely vulnerable person: what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins.
While appearing to own the Queen's English, Eban was not to the manor born: he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry.
He was, in the true sense of the word, a self-made man, whose pluck, ambition, drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements.
His was the aristocracy of the spirit.
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented.
Abdullah Out On A Limb
Crown Prince Abdullah’s peace proposal was born in Saudi Arabia but some allege that it was conceived in the US.  Revealed to a visiting American journalist during a private dinner with the Crown Prince, the plan centers on a “full normalization” of relations between Israel and all Arab countries, in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories it occupied in 1967.  The proposal may get a boost when Abdullah meet President Bush in Texas later this spring, but its early survival depends first on its reception at the upcoming Arab summit in Beirut.

The suspicions which surround Abdullah’s peace initiative, and which dismiss it as stillborn, are founded in the belief that it was conceived to appease Saudi Arabia’s American critics and to divert them from focussing on Saudi domestic tensions.  Since September 11th, Saudi Arabia has felt intense pressure to explain (and explain away) its links to Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda terrorist network because fifteen of the nineteen plane hijackers were Saudis (indeed, the majority of prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are said to be Saudi citizens) and Saudis are often viewed as a major source of al-Qaeda’s finances.  Moreover, it is alleged that the Saudi government has become preoccupied with appeasing America, despite the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, and Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestine.


googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });At the same time, Saudi public opinion has been inflamed, mostly because of their rulers’ apparent apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people, particularly when contrasted with Osama bin Laden’s lethal propaganda.  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Saudi leaders have felt pressed to accommodate public revulsion about the mistreatment of the Palestinians, but worry that doing so may even further jeopardize their now brittle relations with America.

Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative provoked widespread surprise, not because the idea is so startlingly new, but because of its source and timing.  A proposal for “full normalization” with Israel coming from an Islamic regime that bases its legitimacy on the austere Islamic doctrines of the Wahhabi seems both peculiar and progressive.  But Saudi Arabia’s long-cultivated image of stability, benevolence, and mystical communal harmony has given way under the endless glare of the American press.  Its educational system, too, is increasingly portrayed as a breeding ground for hatred of the West.  Something had to give.


America’s seemingly hostile attention gave rise to the speculation that Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative really denotes a Saudi public relations counteroffensive, hatched in the Saudi embassy in Washington to cover over the rift with the US.  Indeed, the subsequent, deafening silence by other Saudi leaders to the proposal appears to confirm it as a public relations move for which they need not risk any of their own domestic political capital.
Although Abdullah is usually referred to in the West as Saudi Arabia’s ruler, the debilitated King Fahd’s six full brothers are the ones who truly represent the real power in the Kingdom.  Almost nothing, neither in support nor in opposition, has been uttered by the King and these other brothers, collectively known as the “Sudairis.”
The Sudairis, it seems, have apparently left their half brother alone to twist in the wind.  Abdullah’s proposal could weaken his position domestically, particularly in relation to the country’s powerful Islamists.
For although Crown Prince Abdullah has his own loyal entourage, including the National Guard, he confronts opposition from senior figures in the religious establishment.
The idea of normalizing relations with Israel has incited fierce hostility among some imams in the mosques as well as on the Internet.
As a result, Abdullah’s initial proposal has been diluted, so much so that, by the time of the Arab foreign ministers meeting held in Cairo on 8 March, the phrase “full normalisation” was watered down to the more amorphous phrase “full peace,” the meaning of which no one knows.
Does it mean an Israeli Star of David flag flying in Riyadh, or that Abdullah will visit Jerusalem to be greeted with a kiss from Ariel Sharon?  No one knows, but the very fact that such questions are being raised in Saudi Arabia poses a serious risk to Abdullah.

Objections are also voiced against the fact that the Crown Prince’s plan does not mention the right of exiled Palestinians to return to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Israel proper, and that Arabs must tailor their diplomatic initiatives to the taste of the American media.  To the average Saudi, the initiative appears as either a sell-out or the prelude to a fresh Arab humiliation.  In either case, it is widely feared that either of these outcomes is intended simply to appease America.

Reactions in the Middle East reflect longstanding rivalries for leadership, as well as fears about American and Israeli intentions.  Egypt’s leaders deem the proposal a mere conversation, something not nearly as serious as a written diplomatic initiative.  Libya offered its own supposedly more “encompassing and comprehensive” proposal.
Hizbollah’s leader Mohammed Fadlallah defined the initiative as one of Arab submission, while Syria demanded a guarantee of its interests in the Golan Heights.
Arab League officials approved the proposal. 
Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative is meant to be made official during a speech at the Arab League summit in Beirut of 27-28 March.
How it is received may not only determine the state of Israel-Palestine negotiations for a considerable time to come, but Saudi Arabia’s domestic peace as well.
Absent-Minded Killers
As a species, human beings have a major self-control problem.
We humans are now so aggressively fishing, hunting, logging, and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally chasing other species off the planet.
Our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life.
In 1992, when the world’s governments first promised to address man-made global warming, they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species.
The Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit, established that “biological diversity is a common concern of humanity.”
The signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity, by saving species and their habitats, and to use biological resources (e.g., forests) in a sustainable manner.
In 2002, the treaty’s signatories went further, committing to “a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss” by 2010.
Unfortunately, like so many other international agreements, the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown, un-championed, and unfulfilled.
That neglect is a human tragedy.
For a very low cash outlay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods.
We kill other species not because we must, but because we are too negligent to do otherwise.
Consider a couple of notorious examples.
Some rich countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand, have fishing fleets that engage in so-called “bottom trawling.”
Bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom, destroying magnificent, unexplored, and endangered marine species in the process.
Complex and unique ecologies, most notably underground volcanoes known as seamounts, are ripped to shreds, because bottom trawling is the “low cost” way to catch a few deep sea fish species.
One of these species, orange roughy, has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century, but already is being fished to the point of collapse.
Likewise, in many parts of the world, tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops.
The result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species, yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost.
After cutting down a swath of rainforest, soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock.
As a result, the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned, with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems.
Because these activities’ costs are so high and their benefits so low, stopping them would be easy.
Bottom trawling should simply be outlawed; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities.
Forest clearing, on the other hand, is probably best stopped by economic incentives, perhaps combined with regulatory limits.
Simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work, since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits.
On the other hand, financial incentives would probably succeed, because cutting down forest to create pastureland is not profitable enough to induce farmers to forego payments for protecting the land.
Many rainforest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rainforest conservation fund by the rich countries, to pay impoverished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest.
A well-designed fund would slow or stop deforestation, preserve biodiversity, and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests.
At the same time, small farmers would receive a steady flow of income, which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household’s wealth, education, and health.
Aside from banning bottom trawling and establishing a global fund for avoided deforestation, we should designate a global network of protected marine areas, in which fishing, boating, polluting, dredging, drilling, and other damaging activities would be prohibited.
Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas.
We also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction, just as we now have such a process for climate change.
Politicians don’t listen very well to individual scientists, but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice.
Finally, the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change.
There can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species’ viability.
As the planet warms, and rain and storm patterns change dramatically, many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival.
Some can migrate, but others (such as polar bears) are likely to be driven to extinction unless we take decisive action to head off climate change.
These measures are achievable by 2010.
They are affordable, and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits.
Most importantly, they would allow us to follow through on a global promise.
It is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species – and jeopardize our own future – in a fit of absent-mindedness.
Polluters Must Pay
NEW YORK – When BP and its drilling partners caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the United States government demanded that BP finance the cleanup, compensate those who suffered damages, and pay criminal penalties for the violations that led to the disaster.
BP has already committed more than $20 billion in remediation and penalties.
Based on a settlement last week, BP will now pay the largest criminal penalty in US history – $4.5 billion.
The same standards for environmental cleanup need to be applied to global companies operating in poorer countries, where their power has typically been so great relative to that of governments that many act with impunity, wreaking havoc on the environment with little or no accountability.
As we enter a new era of sustainable development, impunity must turn to responsibility.
Polluters must pay, whether in rich or poor countries.
Major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions.
Nigeria has been Exhibit A of corporate environmental impunity.
For decades, major oil companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron, have been producing oil in the Niger Delta, an ecologically fragile environment of freshwater swamp forests, mangroves, lowland rainforests, and coastal barrier islands.
This rich habitat supports remarkable biodiversity – or did before the oil companies got there –&#160;and more than 30 million local inhabitants, who depend on the local ecosystems for their health and livelihoods.
Twenty years ago, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classified the Niger Delta as a region of high biodiversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna – tree species, fish, birds, and mammals, among other forms of life – and therefore rated it as a very high priority for conservation.
Yet it also noted that the region’s biodiversity was under massive threat, with little or no protection.
The global companies operating in the delta have spilled oil and flared natural gas for decades, without regard for the natural environment and the communities impoverished and poisoned by their actions.
One estimate puts the cumulative spills over the past 50 years at approximately 10 million barrels – twice the size of the BP spill.
The data are uncertain: there have been many thousands of spills during this period – often poorly documented and their magnitude hidden or simply unmeasured by either the companies or the government.
Indeed, just as BP was being hit with new criminal penalties, ExxonMobil announced yet another pipeline leak in the Niger Delta.
The environmental destruction of the delta is part of a larger saga: corrupt companies operating hand in hand with corrupt government officials.
The companies routinely bribe officials to gain oil leases, lie about output, evade taxes, and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause.
Nigerian officials have become fabulously wealthy, owing to decades of payoffs by international companies that have plundered the delta’s natural wealth.
Shell, the largest foreign operator in the Niger Delta, has been criticized repeatedly for its egregious practices and its unwillingness to be held to account.
Meanwhile, the local population has remained impoverished and beset by diseases caused by unsafe air, poisoned drinking water, and pollution in the food chain.
Local lawlessness has led to gang warfare and persistent illegal tapping into the pipelines to steal oil, leading to further massive oil spills and frequent explosions that kill dozens, including innocent bystanders.
In the colonial era, it was the official purpose of imperial power to extract wealth from the administered territories.
In the post-colonial period, the methods are better disguised.
When oil companies misbehave in Nigeria or elsewhere, they are protected by the power of their home countries.
Don’t mess with the companies, they are told by the United States and Europe.
Indeed, one of the largest bribes (a reputed $180 million) paid in recent times in Nigeria was by Halliburton, a company tightly intertwined with US political power.
(Dick Cheney went from being Halliburton’s CEO to the US vice presidency.)
Last year, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) issued a remarkable report on Ogoniland, a major ethnic homeland in the Niger Delta that has been at the epicenter of conflict between local communities and international oil.
The report was as scathing as it was scientifically clear.
Despite many past promises of a cleanup, Ogoniland remains in environmental agony, impoverished and sickened by the oil industry.
UNEP also offered clear and detailed recommendations, including emergency measures to ensure safe drinking water; cleanup activities targeting the mangroves and soils; public-health studies to identify and counteract the consequences of pollution; and a new regulatory framework.
The world’s governments have recently agreed to move to a new framework for sustainable development, declaring their intention to adopt Sustainable Development Goals at the Rio+20 Summit in June.
The SDGs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear, compelling standards for government and corporate behavior.
Many major companies, including in the oil industry, have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals.
Cleaning up the Niger Delta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability.
Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other major oil companies should step forward and help to fund the necessary cleanup, ushering in a new era of responsibility.
The Nigerian government’s own accountability is on the line as well.
It is heartening that several Nigerian senators have recently been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector.
The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned.
From now on, sustainable development must not be a mere slogan, but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a strained and crowded planet.
Accounting for Gaza
New York – This week the United Nations Human Rights Council will debate the report of the fact-finding mission led by Judge Richard Goldstone on human rights violations in the Gaza conflict.
Let us hope  it is a full and fair examination based on the report’s findings and recommendations.
Goldstone and his team concluded that both Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group controlling Gaza, committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity during the period of the conflict which the investigation addressed. The report calls for credible investigations of  alleged rights violations  and recommends that the UN Security Council require both sides to report back within six months on the results, including any prosecutions they will carry out in connection with the violations identified.
Failure to do so, in the view of Goldstone’s commission, should result in the Security Council referring the matter to the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Unfortunately, rather than debating Goldstone’s detailed findings and the merits of his recommendations on ways to move forward, there are indications that governments may focus instead on the process leading up to the investigation and seek to limit full discussion of the report.
As someone involved in that process, I feel it is important to put my views on record, as comments I made previously are now being used as part of the effort to undermine  Judge Goldstone and his important work.
I refused to accept the invitation from the president of the Human Rights Council at the time, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi of Nigeria, to lead the investigation following the Human Rights Council’s January 12, 2009 resolution. As a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I felt strongly that the Council’s resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground.
It referred only to “the grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks,” and called for a mission to investigate “all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying power, Israel, against the Palestinian people.”  
I was also aware that the UN Human Rights Council had made repeated condemnations of Israel over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries.
This pattern of action and inaction by the Council has given greater credence to those who believe the UN’s highest human rights body is inherently anti-Israel.  
I decided I could not undertake the mission for these reasons.
I am aware that Judge Goldstone, a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate, shared similar concerns when he was initially approached.
But he was able to work with the Council’s president to secure an agreement  he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken byboth parties to the conflict.
Experts can debate whether this was in conformity with UN rules and procedures.
I have no doubt that those involved were seeking a way forward that would allow for a full investigation and help overcome the political divisiveness currently  undermining the Human Rights Council within the UN system.
The question now is whether governments will give Judge Goldstone’s findings the serious attention they deserve, or instead fall back into an overtly political posture.
As Goldstone's report makes clear:
Both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they are forced to lead: For the Palestinians, the anger about individual events – the civilian casualties, injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks, the blockade, the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders – feed into an underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation, its daily humiliations and their as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination.
For the Israelis, the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people.
In this way, both the Israelis and the Palestinians share a secret fear – for some, a belief – that each has no intention of accepting the other’s right to a country of their own.
This anger and fear are unfortunately ably represented by many politicians.
(Para.
1705)
For the sake of human rights and peace in the region, my hope is that the international community will bear witness to these circumstances, consider Judge Goldstone’s report in its entirety and press for accountability for the most serious crimes.
Accounting Tricks Around the Globe
Accounting chicanery will be high on the agenda of the bankers who will meet at the annual IMF/World Bank gathering in Washington, D.C. The IMF should do more than offer the private sector advice about how to fix its accounting problems; governmental accounting tricks and the IMF's own wheezes should also be addressed, says Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz.
The Arthur Anderson and Enron scandals in America have focused attention on the problems of accounting in private businesses.
But the scale of this corruption should not blind us to the problem of public sector accounting, where many deceitful things are also being done.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Accounting rules are designed to provide standardized frameworks within which the financial position of a firm, or government, can be assessed.
Bad accounting frameworks always lead to bad information, and bad information leads to bad decisions, with serious long term consequences.
This is true in the public as well as the private sector.
America's business scandals showed how accounting rules can be bent and abused to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a company.
The Bush Administration, not to be left behind, has shown how public accounting rules can be bent so as to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a national economy.
Indeed, last year saw what may be the largest accounting fraud ever conducted, as a mega-surplus of more than $3trillion for the years 2002 to 2011 was transformed into a $2 trillion deficit.
Investors in Enron waited years before discovering that something was amiss. Though sudden and vast, the change in America's fiscal stance already provides a clear inkling that something was amiss.
It will be years before the full magnitude of President Bush's deception is apparent.
Meanwhile, the Bush Administration will blame the sinking economy, bad luck, and unintentional miscalculations for the vanished surplus.
But America is not alone in allowing for official accounting shenanigans.
In Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world, the IMF imposes accounting frameworks that not only make little sense, but result in excessive austerity.
In some of the poorest countries in the world - ie, those most dependent on aid - the IMF has argued that foreign aid should not be listed as revenue in a government's budget calculations.
But what else is aid if it is not revenue?
The IMF's argument seems to be this: a country cannot rely on foreign aid because aid is too unstable.
The truth, of course, is that aid is more stable than tax revenues in poor countries.
By the IMF's logic, neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in budgets.
If that is the case, every country in the world is in deep trouble.
The absurdity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves.
But donor countries want to see the money they give to finance schools or health clinics spent on schools and health clinics; they don't want to see it added to a nation's reserves.
Governments in developing countries have thecorrect answer to the problem of revenue instability: expenditure flexibility.
Build schools when you have aid; stop building them when you don't.
For years, World Bank economists have tried to convince the IMF to see this logic, with little progress.
Other IMF accounting practices, including how the capital expenditures of government-owned enterprises are treated, are also causing outrage.
If a state owned enterprisein Latin America wants to borrow to make an investment, in Latin America such borrowing is treated as an addition to the deficit.
Investors, worried about the size of a government deficit, see only the bottom line.
But if a company can buy a $1 billion asset for $500 million,economic logic says buy the asset.
The balance sheet is improved by $500 million.
But byIMF logic,all you see in the accounts is increased expenditure and borrowing, not the value of the acquired asset.
Because of this rule, investors may only see an apparent worsening of the country's fiscal position, and so may demand higher interest rates.
Of course, foreign investors like this IMF logic: government corporations are put at a distinct disadvantage: their ability to invest inhibited, these firms cannot compete to make acquisitions.
A second IMF accounting distortion involves stabilization funds.
These are national funds that, in boom years, receive revenues from sales of natural resources to be set aside against a rainy day.
This makes sense.
But IMF accounting inhibits the use of these funds to help stabilize an economy through counter-cyclical fiscal spending.
According to Mexican and Chilean officials I have discussed the matter with, spending from a stabilization fund is reportedly treated as if the country is borrowing, thus adding to its deficit.
It is, of course, in times of economic downturn that countries worry most about their credit rating, so the IMF stance is particularly unhelpful.
IMF accounting frameworks, rather than providing useful signals to the market, provide distorted information that exacerbates a troubled country's problems.
Good decisions requireaccurateinformation, and this comes only through good accounting frameworks.
Of course, no perfect accounting framework exists, but some frameworks systematically distort.
Indeed, a hidden agenda often exists in the choice of an accounting framework.
Not including stock options inside the accounting framework served US corporate interests, and those of individual bosses, well.
The IMF's distorted and unfair accounting frameworks may also serve a hidden purpose: to force governments to shrink expenditures.
But there are high economic and social costs to this agenda, one that goes far beyond the IMF's mandate.
Achieving Growth in a Rebalanced World
MILAN – Although the financial crisis is winding down, the prospects for growth in the global economy are unlikely to pick up. This is, in part, inevitable.
But it is also the result of poor coordination between governments as the world economy rebalances.
Prior to the crisis, American consumers, on average, either saved nothing or accumulated debt.
That has now changed.
With household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other asset-price declines, pensions and retirement provisions are in disarray.
Because asset prices will not reach pre-crisis levels anytime soon (that is, without inflating another bubble and risking renewed instability), household saving in the United States has risen to about 5% of disposable income, and probably will rise further.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });This withdrawal of the US consumer is part (perhaps half) of the process of rebalancing the global economy.
Restoring America’s savings-investment balance implies a reduction in global aggregate demand of around $800 billion.
To be sure, fiscal deficits and emergency measures in advanced economies and some major developing countries have cushioned the sharp decline, substituting in part for missing consumers.
But this substitution cannot continue indefinitely.
In advanced countries, governments will eventually be forced to reduce spending, and central banks will withdraw from emergency credit provisions and guarantees.
As a result, many believe that a “new normal” of slower advanced-country growth is upon us.
Despite a recovery in asset prices in many countries and the deceleration of negative growth, unemployment is high and rising.
Risk spreads have declined from their mid-crisis highs, but credit in many sectors remains tight or barely available, while the financial sector is set to become more conservative – and is likely to be re-regulated with higher capital, reserve, and margin requirements.
And this is just the baseline scenario.
Downside risks include fiscal destabilization resulting from a failure to rein in deficits, inflation and withdrawal of central bank autonomy, and loss of confidence in the dollar, which continues to be the reserve currency for the global economy.
Little wonder, then, that many knowledgeable analysts reasonably expect post-crisis growth in advanced countries to be lower, perhaps by 0.5 to 1%.
A 1% slowdown in advanced-country growth translates into roughly $350 billion of missing aggregate demand every year, in addition to the shortfall because of rebalancing in the US.
If the slowdown in advanced countries persists, pre-crisis growth levels will not be achievable in the developing world either, owing to insufficient demand to absorb the implied increase in output.
Of course, individual developing countries may be spared.
But it is an unfortunate mathematical fact that not everyone can gain market share.
If the advanced-country scenario is right, many developing countries will lose out and experience sharply diminished growth.
Prior to the crisis, many suspected that the mix of aggregate demand that was supporting high growth was unsustainable, though the problem perhaps seemed too hypothetical to compel collective action.
Not anymore.
But the collective action problem is no less daunting, and it requires urgent attention if the world’s growth aspirations are to be achieved.
The problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher private-sector competitiveness, but also by means of protectionist measures.
And, as we have seen in many countries’ efforts to ameliorate the crisis, the non-cooperative protectionist response is much more likely to be adopted – despite wide recognition that it is highly destructive – when aggregate demand is in short supply.
So what can be done to shore up global aggregate demand and growth prospects, while preserving the economic openness that has benefited major parts of the developing world so greatly in the past 30 years?
First, countries with current-account surpluses such as Germany, Japan and China must recognize that their own growth (and that of others) depends on reducing the global savings-investment imbalance, which will result in narrowing external deficits elsewhere.
This needs to be done on a sustained basis following the withdrawal of extraordinary fiscal stimulus.
Second, everyone must recognize their stake in restoring balanced advanced-country growth as much and as soon as possible in order to counter the ongoing shortfall in aggregate demand.
After all, advanced countries account for about two-thirds of global GDP, so slow growth in these countries will inevitably impede global growth and truncate the growth potential of much of the developing world.
This challenge, however, is very complex because deleveraging and rebalancing cannot be completed overnight.
But key steps can and should be taken: restoration of fiscal balance in well-communicated plans, commitment to central bank autonomy and low inflation, and striking a thoughtful balance between under- and over-regulation of the financial sector.
Externally, major trading partners and holders of advanced-country assets can support rebalancing by agreeing to avoid sudden and potentially destabilizing shifts in the composition of their balance sheets.
So, two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world’s economic agenda in the months ahead.
The first is re-regulation of advanced countries financial systems with a view to ensuring greater stability without impairing essential functions or unnecessarily elevating the cost of capital.
The second is a set of understandings and commitments among the major advanced and developing countries to rebalance the global economy in order to restore aggregate demand and growth.
If that can be accomplished, the world will have taken a major step toward a relatively smooth, effective, and equitable global economic recovery.
The Trade Delusion
LONDON – Since 2008, global trade has grown slightly more slowly than global GDP.
The Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations ended in failure.
Transatlantic and transpacific trade negotiations are progressing slowly, held back by the resistance of special interests.
But, though many experts fear that protectionism is undermining globalization, threatening to impede global economic growth, slower growth in global trade may be inevitable, and trade liberalization is decreasingly important.
To be sure, for 65 years, rapid trade growth has played a vital role in economic development, with average advanced-economy industrial tariffs plummeting from more than 30% to below 5%.
The creation of Europe’s single market facilitated increased intra-European trade.
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan achieved rapid economic catch-up on the basis of export-led growth.
China has followed the same path over the last 30 years.
Trade grew about twice as fast as global output from 1990 to 2008.
But there is no reason why trade should grow faster than GDP forever.
Indeed, even if there were no trade barriers at all, trade might grow significantly more slowly than GDP in some periods.
Several factors make it possible that we are entering such a period.
For starters, there is the changing pattern of consumption in the advanced economies.
Richer people spend an increasing share of their income on services that are either impossible to trade (for example, restaurant meals) or difficult to trade (such as health services).
Non-tradable sectors tend to account for a growing share of employment and economic activity.
For several decades, that tendency has been offset by ever more intensive trading of tradable goods, often passing through many countries in complex supply chains.
In the future, however, the shift to non-tradable consumption may dominate.
Indeed, trade intensity may decline even for manufactured goods.
Trade is partly driven by differences in labor costs.
China’s dramatic manufacturing growth reflected low wages up to now.
But as real wages in China and other emerging economies grow, incentives for trade will decline.
The more that global incomes converge, the less trade there may be.
In addition, as the economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT have argued in their book The Second Machine Age, rapid advances in information technology may enable increasingly extensive automation.
Some manufacturing activities, though few jobs, may well return to developed countries, as the advantages of proximity to customers and lower transport costs outweigh decreasingly important differences in labor costs.
Global trade as a share of GDP may therefore decline, but without adverse consequences for global economic growth.
Rising productivity does not require relentlessly increasing trade intensity.
Earth, after all, does not trade with other planets, yet its economy still grows.
Optimal trade intensity depends on many factors – such as relative labor costs, transport costs, productivity levels, and economy-of-scale effects.
Trends in these factors might make reduced trade intensity not only inevitable but desirable.
Even if that is true, international trade will still play a vital role, and preventing any reversal of past trade liberalization is essential.
But further trade liberalization is bound to be of declining importance to economic growth.
With industrial tariffs already dramatically reduced most potential benefits of trade liberalization have already been grasped.
Estimates of the benefits of further trade liberalization are often surprisingly low – no more than a few percentage points of global GDP.
That is small compared to the cost of the 2008 financial crisis, which has left output in several advanced economies 10-15% below pre-crisis trend levels.
It is small, too, compared to the difference in economic performance between successful catch-up countries – such as China – and other countries that have enjoyed the same access to global markets but have performed less well for other reasons.
The main reason for slow progress in trade negotiations is not increasing protectionism; it is the fact that further liberalization entails complex trade-offs no longer offset by very large potential benefits.
The Doha Round’s failure has been decried as a setback for developing countries.
And some liberalization – say, of advanced economies’ cotton imports – would undoubtedly benefit some low-income economies.
But full trade liberalization would have a complex impact on the least developed economies, some of which would benefit only if compensated for the loss of the preferential access to advanced-economy markets that they currently enjoy.
This implies that further progress in trade liberalization will be slow.
But slow progress is a far less important challenge to growth prospects than the debt overhang in developed economies, or infrastructure and educational deficiencies in many developing economies.
That reality often goes unacknowledged.
The importance of past trade liberalization has left the global policy establishment with a bias toward assuming that further liberalization would bring similar benefits.
But while the potential global benefits of trade liberalization have declined, reduced trade intensity might still impede economic development in some countries.
Only a handful of economies over the last 60 years have fully caught up to advanced-economy living standards, and all relied on export-led growth to drive productivity and job creation in manufacturing.
Relying solely on that model will be more difficult in the future.
China is so big that it must develop domestic drivers of growth at an earlier stage of development than did Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea; as a result, its exports will inevitably decline (relative to GDP).
Meanwhile, for some low-income countries, increased manufacturing and service-sector automation of the sort described by Brynjolfsson and McAfee, whether within advanced economies or within China’s established industrial clusters, will make the path to middle- and high-income status more difficult to achieve.
That poses important challenges for development policy, which further trade liberalization can alleviate only marginally.
When Fewer Is Better
LONDON – Is a shrinking population always a bad thing?
Judging by the lamentations of some economists and policymakers in the advanced economies, where people are living longer and birth rates have fallen below replacement levels, one certainly might think so.
In fact, the benefits of demographic stability – or even slight decline – outweigh any adverse effects.
To be sure, an aging population poses obvious challenges for pension systems.
And, as economists like Paul Krugman have suggested, it could also mean that advanced economies face not only a slow recovery, but also the danger of “secular stagnation.”
With slower population growth, the need to invest in capital stock diminishes.
Meanwhile, people planning for longer retirements may save more to ensure adequate pensions.
If these savings exceed investment needs, they could lead to inadequate aggregate demand, depressing economic growth.
But the policy challenges associated with these demographic shifts are manageable.
And, perhaps more important, the benefits of increased longevity and reduced fertility are considerable.
Rising life expectancy is the welcome product of medical and economic progress, and additional increases are almost certain.
Indeed, the average life expectancy for children born in prosperous countries could soon exceed 100.
That implies an ever-rising ratio of those over 65 to younger cohorts.
But as long as average retirement ages rise to keep stable the proportions of life spent in work and in retirement, the fact that working and retirement years are growing at equal rates has no adverse economic effect.
There is, moreover, strong evidence that rising longevity can mean more years of healthy active life, not unhealthy dependency.
Only bad policies, such as the recent German commitment to reduce retirement ages, can turn longer lives into an economic problem.
Declining fertility, including in some lower- and middle-income countries, such as Iran and Brazil, also reflects hugely positive social developments – particularly the empowerment of women.
Wherever women have the right to an education and to choose how many children to have, fertility rates fall to or slightly below replacement levels.
Falling birth rates challenge pension systems more than rising longevity, because they imply a rising old-age dependency ratio even if retirement ages increase in line with life expectancy.
But as long as birth rates are only slightly below replacement level, pension systems’ sustainability can be ensured by means of affordable increases in contribution rates.
And lower birth rates deliver the offsetting benefit of lower child dependency ratios, reducing education costs or enabling increased investment in education per child.
Slower population growth might also reduce the increase in wealth-to-income ratios, and the resulting increase in inequality that Thomas Piketty recently highlighted.
In many countries, the increase results primarily from the rise in real-estate prices relative to income, as more prosperous people devote a growing share of their income to purchasing property in desirable locations.
Continued population growth would intensify competition for such “positional goods,” which are not easily supplied in greater volume.
A stable population, or actual decline, would reduce their importance somewhat.
It would also make it easier to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions at an acceptable cost, and to preserve and enhance local environmental quality, which people increasingly value as their incomes rise.
For today’s advanced economies, a stable or slightly declining population would likely be optimal for human welfare.
For the world as a whole, it is a desirable goal.
But it is also a distant goal. Indeed, population decline in the advanced countries remains far less of a problem than rapid population growth in many developing countries.
The United Nations’ medium fertility scenario projects that the world’s population will rise from seven billion today to ten billion by 2050.
Nigeria’s population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050, while Yemen’s could grow from 18 million to 42 million.
High fertility rates in many countries are partly a consequence of low income.
But causation also runs the other way.
High fertility rates stymie prospects for economic growth, because excessively rapid population growth makes it impossible to accumulate per capita stocks of physical and human capital at the pace required to drive rapid income gains.
That said, efforts to control population growth through measures like China’s compulsory one-child policy are both morally abhorrent and unnecessary.
As examples like Iran show, even low-income countries can achieve dramatic fertility reductions simply by providing choice and education.
But that does not change the fact that China’s rapid fertility decline played a major role in its extraordinary economic breakthrough.
Facile commentary often suggests the opposite: countries with high fertility rates supposedly enjoy the demographic dividend of a rapidly rising and youthful population.
But, beyond some rate of population growth, jobs cannot be created fast enough to absorb the growing workforce.
Almost all countries with fertility rates well above replacement levels face economically and socially harmful youth-unemployment rates.
Political instability in the Middle East has many causes, but among them is the lack of jobs for young people, especially young men.
Yes, demographic slowdown may, as Krugman and others have argued, increase the risk of deficient demand and below-potential growth.
But if the problem is inadequate demand, the danger can be averted.
Governments and central banks can always create additional nominal demand if they are willing to use all of the policy tools available to them, such as debt- or money-financed public investment.
And if there are underused resources, additional real growth will result.
If aging populations lead to secular stagnation, the cause will be deficient policies.
By contrast, the problems created by excessively rapid population growth are rooted in real and unavoidable constraints.
The manageable challenges created by rising life expectancy and lower birth rates should not be allowed to obscure the huge benefits of greater longevity and population stabilization.
And it certainly should not blind us to the adverse economic and social consequences of rapid population growth.
Rethinking the Monetization Taboo
LONDON – Now that the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s “tapering” of its asset-purchase program has been debated to death, attention will increasingly turn to prospects for interest-rate increases.
But another question looms: How will central banks achieve a final “exit” from unconventional monetary policy and return balance sheets swollen by unconventional monetary policy to “normal” levels?
To many, a larger issue needs to be addressed.
The Fed’s tapering merely slows the growth of its balance sheet.
The authorities would still have to sell $3 trillion of bonds to return to the pre-crisis status quo.
The rarely admitted truth, however, is that there is no need for central banks’ balance sheets to shrink.
They could stay permanently larger; and, for some countries, permanently bigger central-bank balance sheets will help reduce public-debt burdens.
As a recent IMF paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff illustrates, advanced economies face debt burdens that cannot be reduced simply through a mix of austerity, forbearance, and growth.
But if a central bank owns the debt of its own government, no net public liability exists.
The government owns the central bank, so the debt is to itself, and the interest expense comes back to the government as the central bank’s profit.
If central bank holdings of government debt were converted into non-interest-bearing perpetual obligations, nothing substantive would change, but it would become obvious that some previously issued public debt did not need to be repaid.
This amounts to “helicopter money” after the fact.
In 2003, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that Japan, facing deflation, should increase public expenditure or cut taxes, funding the operation by printing money rather than issuing bonds.
This, he argued, was bound to increase national income, because the direct stimulative effect would not be offset by concern about future debt burdens.
His advice was not followed; large Japanese deficits were in fact bond-financed.
But the debts held by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could still be written off.
In Japan’s case, this would reduce government debt by an amount equal to more than 40% of GDP today, and around 60% if implemented after the bond purchases planned for 2014.
Objections focus on two risks: central-bank losses and excessive inflation.
But both of these outcomes can be avoided.
Central banks have bought government bonds with money on which they currently pay zero or very low interest rates.
So, as interest rates rise, central banks might face costs exceeding their income.
But central banks can choose to pay zero interest on a portion of the reserves that commercial banks hold with them, even when they increase the policy interest rate.
And they can require commercial banks to hold zero-interest reserves at the central bank equal to a defined proportion of their loans, thus preventing inflationary growth of private credit and money.
Permanent monetization of government debts is undoubtedly technically possible.
Whether it is desirable depends on the outlook for inflation.
Where inflation is returning to target levels, debt monetization could be unnecessarily and dangerously stimulative.
Central-bank bond sales, while certainly not inevitable, may be appropriate.
But if deflation is the danger, permanent monetization may be the best policy.
I predict that Japan will, in effect, permanently monetize some government debt.
After two decades of low growth and deflation, Japanese gross public debt is now above 240% of GDP (and above 140% of GDP on a net basis); and, with the fiscal deficit at 9.5% of GDP, the debt burden continues to increase.
According to the IMF, to reduce its net public debt to 80% of GDP by 2030, Japan would have to turn today’s 8.6% primary budget deficit (the balance excluding interest payments) into a 6.7% primary surplus by 2020 and maintain such surpluses continuously until 2030.
That will not happen, and any attempt to reach that target would drive Japan into a severe depression.
But the government does not need to repay the ¥140 trillion ($1.4 trillion) of its debt that the BoJ already owns.
The BoJ will continue to increase its balance sheet until it achieves its 2% inflation target.
Thereafter, its balance sheet may stabilize in absolute yen terms and fall slowly as a percentage of GDP, but its absolute size will probably never decrease – a likelihood that should cause no concern.
It is precisely what happened to the Fed’s balance sheet after its wartime and postwar buying of US government bonds came to an end in 1951.
Even as permanent monetization occurs, however, the truth may be obfuscated.
If government bond repayments to the BoJ continued, but were always offset by new BoJ bond purchases, and if the BoJ kept the interest rate on reserves at zero, the net effect would be the same as a debt write-off, but the fiction of “normal” central-bank operations could be maintained.
Central banks can monetize debt while pretending not to.
That pretense may reflect a useful taboo: if we overtly recognize that debt write-off/monetization is possible, politicians might want to do it all the time and in excess, not just in circumstances that make it appropriate.
The historical experience of Weimar Germany, or that of Zimbabwe today, illustrates the danger.
As a result, even when permanent monetization occurs – as it almost certainly will in Japan and possibly elsewhere – it may remain forever the policy that dare not speak its name.
Such reticence may serve a useful purpose.
But it must not blind central banks and governments to the full range of policy tools available to address today’s severe debt overhangs.
The Great Credit Mistake
LONDON – Before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, private credit in most developed economies grew faster than GDP.
Then credit growth collapsed.
Whether that fall reflected low demand for credit or constrained supply may seem like a technical issue.
But the answer holds important implications for policymaking and prospects for economic growth.
And the official answer is probably wrong.
The prevailing view has usually stressed supply constraints and the policies needed to fix them.
An impaired banking system, it is argued, starves businesses, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), of the funds they need to expand.
In September 2008, US President George W. Bush wanted to “free up banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses.”
The stress tests and recapitalizations of US banks in 2009 were subsequently hailed as crucial to the recovery of both the banking system and the economy.
By contrast, the European Central Bank’s inadequately tough stress tests in 2010 were widely panned for leaving eurozone banks too weak to provide adequate credit.
In the United Kingdom, banks have been criticized for not lending the reserves created by quantitative easing to the real economy, leading the Bank of England to introduce its “funding for lending” scheme in 2012.
In the eurozone, it is hoped that this year’s asset quality review (AQR) and stress tests will finally dispel concerns about bank solvency and free up credit supply.
A “credit crunch” – particularly in trade finance – was certainly a key reason why the financial crisis generated a real economy recession.
Taxpayer-funded bank rescues, higher bank capital requirements, and ultra-easy monetary policy have all been vital to overcome credit supply constraints.
But there is strong evidence that once the immediate crisis was over, lack of demand for credit played a far larger role than restricted supply in impeding economic growth.
That argument is persuasively made by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi in House of Debt, an important new book that analyzes US data on a county-by-county basis.
Mian and Sufi show that the recession was caused by a collapse of household consumption, and that consumption fell most in those counties where pre-crisis borrowing and post-crisis real-estate prices left households facing the largest relative losses in net wealth.
It was in those US counties, too, that local businesses cut employment most aggressively.
For SMEs, a shortage of customers, not a shortage of credit, constrained borrowing, employment, and output.
And the customers were absent because the pre-crisis credit boom had left them over-leveraged.
In the UK, many business surveys from 2009-2012 told the same story.
Poor customer demand was ranked well ahead of credit availability as a constraint on growth.
Economic growth can indeed continue to be severely depressed by a debt overhang even when credit supply is unrestricted and cheap.
Many Japanese companies were left overleveraged by the boom and bust in credit and real estate in the 1980s and early 1990s.
By the late 1990s, the Japanese banking system was offering companies loans at near-zero interest rates.
But, rather than borrow to invest, firms cut investment to pay down debt, driving two decades of stagnation and deflation.
Since 2011, the ECB’s analysis of weak eurozone growth has stressed the negative impact of an impaired and fragmented financial system, with high sovereign-bond yields and funding costs for banks resulting in prohibitive lending terms in the peripheral countries.
Major progress in fixing these problems has already been achieved.
The ECB’s latest Monthly Bulletin documents this, citing multiple indicators of improved credit availability and pricing.
Nonetheless, the rate of decline in private-sector loans has accelerated over the last year – from -0.6% to -2% – and low demand is acknowledged to be the main driver of depressed credit growth.
Simultaneous private deleveraging and fiscal consolidation are restricting eurozone growth far more than remaining restrictions on credit supply.
Despite the ECB’s own evidence, however, the policy focus remains on fixing the credit-supply problem, through the AQR and stress tests, and through the ECB’s own version of a funding for lending scheme, announced on June 5.
That reflects a recurring tendency in official policy debates, particularly in the eurozone, to concentrate on fixable problems to the exclusion of more difficult issues.
Fixing impaired banking systems after a crisis is both essential and achievable.
Moreover, even when public rescue costs are inevitable, they are typically small change compared to the economic harm wrought by the financial crisis and post-crisis recession.
By contrast, a large debt overhang may be intractable unless policy orthodoxies are challenged.
Japan offset private deleveraging in the 1990s by running massive public deficits.
The US has pulled out of recession faster than the eurozone, not only – or even primarily – because it fixed its banking system faster, but because it pursued more stimulative fiscal policies.
But fiscal stimulus is constrained within the eurozone, where member countries no longer issue their own currency and “sovereign” debt therefore carries a default risk.
Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy.
To survive and thrive, the eurozone will need to become more centralized, with some common fiscal revenues, expenditures, and debts.
Of course, this scenario implies immensely difficult political choices.
But the starting point for debate must be realism about the nature and severity of the problems facing the eurozone.
If eurozone policy assumes that fixing the banks will fix the economy, the next ten years in Europe could look like the 1990s in Japan.
Adapting to Climate Change
COPENHAGEN – Striking the right balance between preventing global warming and adapting to its effects is one of the most important – and most vexing – policy questions of our age.
It is also often ignored.
According to the conventional wisdom of many environmental campaigners, we should first do everything we can to mitigate global warming, and only then focus on adaptation strategies.
This seems wrong – even immoral – if we could do more for people and the planet through adaptation.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Moreover, it is inconsistent with the inescapable fact that, whatever we do, we cannot prevent all of global warming’s effects.
If we are ill-prepared, global warming will cause more deaths and devastation, especially in poor countries and fragile societies.
Adaptation would also mean saving many lives from catastrophes not related to global warming.
If we prepare societies for more ferocious hurricanes in the future, for example, we are also helping them to cope better with today’s extreme weather.
There has been a huge amount of research into the ways that humans cause climate change, and how we can reduce it.
Much less work has been devoted to adaptation.
It is important to acknowledge that some adaptation strategies will lead to more greenhouse-gas emissions.
Responding to water scarcity by re-using and treating wastewater, or through deep-well pumping and desalination, will increase fossil-fuel use.
Using more air-conditioning to cool our houses in summer will do the same – although this is vital if we want to save lives.
Adaptation could allow for higher carbon emissions in another way: reducing the damage and harm that we experience from global warming, giving us more time to implement alternatives to reliance on fossil fuels.
Should any of this stop us from using adaptation strategies?
To arrive at an informed answer, we need to work out how the planet will look in 2100 if we invest different amounts in adaptation and carbon cuts.
We need to take into account the increase in emissions that adaptation will cause.
The most critical issue isn’t any rise or fall in emissions. It is how much climate damage we can avoid.
How much of the planet can we help by dealing with rising sea levels?
How many lives can we spare from heat, starvation, or malaria?
These are the real reasons we care about global warming.
Reaching a proper answer to these questions requires extensive economic modeling, with different variables calculated and regional differences analyzed.
New research by three Italian economists, Francesco Bosello, Carlo Carraro, and Enrica De Cian does this, and, ultimately, provides a powerful economic case for a much greater focus on adaptation.
They first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-century.
This work is based on standard scenarios, and carries the typical caveats of predictions far into the future.
Nevertheless, they find that many of our biggest concerns will turn out to be trivial, or even beneficial.
Sea-level rises will be a very minor concern for every country, with the financial impact adding up to less than 0.1% of GDP.
Health problems will be negligible for all but a few nations.
And global warming’s impact would reduce energy consumption for almost all nations.
The important effects are on agriculture and tourism, where nations will lose, on average, about 0.5% of GDP from each sector.
But much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment.
Farmers will choose plants that thrive in heat.
New houses will be designed to deal with warmer temperatures.
Simple economic models, often quoted in the media, show that unconstrained global warming would cost a substantial 2% of GDP in the rich world by the end of the century.
But this fails to acknowledge that people will change their behavior when the environment changes.
Taking adaptation into account, rich countries will adapt to the negative consequences of global warming and exploit the positive changes, creating a totalpositive effect of global warming worth about 0.1% of GDP.
Poor countries will be hit harder, however.
Adaptation will reduce the climate change-related losses from 5% of GDP to slightly less than 3% – but this is still a significant impact.
The real challenge of global warming, therefore, lies in tackling its impact on the Third World.
Here, more needs to be done, above and beyond the adaptation that will happen naturally.
Importantly, the new research shows that adaptation would achieve a lot more than cuts in carbon emissions.
Reducing emissions to a level that does not extinguish economic growth could avert $3 trillion worth of damage, whereas adaptation could prevent around $8 trillion worth of damage.
For every dollar spent on adaptation, we would achieve about $1.70 worth of positive changes for the planet.
The economic case for focusing more on adaptation is clear.
The crucial next step is to ensure that economic arguments become a stronger part of our political debate about how to address global warming.
The New Climate Economics
NEW YORK – This Friday, in its latest comprehensive assessment of the evidence on global warming, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will show that the world’s climate scientists are more certain than ever that human activity – largely combustion of fossil fuels – is causing temperatures and sea levels to rise.
In recent years, a series of extreme weather events – including Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey, floods in China, and droughts in the American Midwest, Russia, and many developing countries – have caused immense damage.
Last week, Mexico experienced simultaneous hurricanes in the Pacific and in the Gulf of Mexico that devastated towns and cities in their path.
Climate change will be a major driver of such events, and we risk much worse.
This puts a new debate center stage: how to reconcile increased action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with strong economic growth.
It is a debate that is already mired in controversy.
As most countries have started making serious investments in renewable energy, and many are implementing carbon prices and regulations, critics complain that such policies may undermine growth.
With the global economy still recovering from the 2008 financial crash, higher energy costs – not yet fully offset by greater energy efficiency – are worrying business and political leaders.
The advent of shale gas has confused the energy debate even more.
If gas is substituted for coal, it can be a useful bridge to a low-carbon future.
But astonishingly, it is coal, the dirtiest fuel, that is experiencing the sharpest increase in use.
Companies and investors are hedging their bets by taking a few resource-efficiency measures and investing in some low-carbon assets, but leaving their high-carbon portfolios and activities largely intact.
Policy vacillation in some countries has not helped.
Advocates of stronger action respond that low-carbon investments can generate much stronger, cleaner growth.
They point to the savings available from energy efficiency, and to the market opportunities generated by clean-energy technologies as the processes of learning and discovery take hold.
They seek to demonstrate the benefits that a more sustainable pattern of development can bring to the world’s cities, to people’s health (from the reduction in air pollution), to energy security, and to the ability of the world’s poor to access energy.
And they propose green bonds and public investment banks to finance new infrastructure and jobs at a time when world interest rates are low and demand is depressed in many countries.
These are serious economic debates, but too often they have become entangled in ideological disputes about the appropriate response to the economic crisis and the value of government intervention in markets.
That is regrettable.
Climate change is not a partisan issue, and climate policy is essentially market-based.
It is about correcting market failures so that markets and entrepreneurship can play their proper role of ensuring innovation and efficient resource allocation.
In order to escape this impasse, we have helped to launch the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.
The Commission’s New Climate Economy project brings together seven leading policy research institutes from six continents, overseen by a panel of former heads of government and finance ministers and prominent business leaders, and advised by a panel of leading economists from across the world.
Its purpose is to provide authoritative new evidence concerning how governments and businesses can achieve stronger economic growth while simultaneously addressing climate risks.
Few governments or investors start from the standpoint of climate change.
They want to promote investment and economic growth, create jobs, stabilize public finances, expand markets, turn profits, ensure reliable energy and food supplies, produce goods and services, reduce poverty, and build cities.
So the primary question that we need to ask is not whether we can reduce emissions, but how public policy can help to achieve these core goals while reducing emissions and building a more climate-resilient economy.
There is now a lot of experience around the world in this area.
When the Stern Review on the economics of climate change was published seven years ago, the subject was largely theoretical.
Now countries at all stages of development are pursuing new patterns of economic growth that take climate into account.
Germany, for example, is planning the world’s most ambitious low-carbon energy transition, based on energy conservation and renewables.
South Korea has made “green growth” a central economic goal.
Mexico’s 2012 General Law on Climate Change has put it on course for a major increase in clean power.
China has placed the industrial development of green technologies at the top of its agenda.
Ethiopia is seeking to move to lower-carbon farming.
Brazil has significantly reduced the rate of deforestation in the Amazon.
Some major businesses are providing powerful examples of what is possible.
Unilever has committed to the sustainable sourcing of agricultural and forest products.
Coca-Cola is phasing out all use of climate-polluting hydrofluorocarbons.
The retail giant Wal-Mart is driving emissions reduction throughout its supply chain.
Meanwhile, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank have stopped lending to high-emission coal plants.
Yet genuine questions remain about how fast economies should move on to a low-carbon path, and the most effective way to do so.
Some low-carbon policies have clearly been expensive, while other, apparently cost-effective options, have not been pursued at all.
Any structural transformation involves costs, trade-offs, and uncertainties, and it is vital that we understand these properly.
Powerful interests will, of course, oppose any low-carbon transition, dismissing and often drowning out those who stand to benefit.
That makes it even more important to clarify the choices.
As science makes clear how imperative the climate question is, it is time for economists and policymakers to explain how it can be answered.
The Mouse Click that Roared
CAMBRIDGE – Until recently, cyber security has primarily interested computer geeks and cloak-and-dagger types.
The Internet’s creators, part of a small, enclosed community, were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern.
But, with some three billion or so users on the Web nowadays, that very openness has become a serious vulnerability; indeed, it is endangering the vast economic opportunities that the Internet has opened for the world.
A “cyber attack” can take any number of forms, including simple probes, defacement of Web sites, denial-of-service attacks, espionage, and destruction of data.
And the term “cyber war,” though best defined as any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent to major physical violence, remains equally protean, reflecting definitions of “war” that range from armed conflict to any concerted effort to solve a problem (for example, “war on poverty”).
Cyber war and cyber espionage are largely associated with states, while cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors.
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime; but, over the next decade or so, cyber war and cyber terrorism may become greater threats than they are today.
Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap.
Terrorists might buy malware from criminals, and governments might find it useful to hide behind both.
Some people argue that deterrence does not work in cyberspace, owing to the difficulties of attribution.
But that is facile: inadequate attribution affects inter-state deterrence as well, yet it still operates.
Even when the source of an attack can be successfully disguised under a “false flag,” governments may find themselves sufficiently enmeshed in symmetrically interdependent relationships such that a major attack would be counterproductive.
China, for example, would lose from an attack that severely damaged the American economy, and vice versa.
An unknown attacker may also be deterred by cyber-security measures.
If firewalls are strong, or redundancy and resilience allow quick recovery, or the prospect of a self-enforcing response (“an electric fence”) seems possible, an attack becomes less attractive.
While accurate attribution of the ultimate source of a cyber attack is sometimes difficult, the determination does not have to be airtight.
To the extent that false flags are imperfect and rumors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible (though not legally probative), reputational damage to an attacker’s soft power may contribute to deterrence.
Finally, a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of retaliation can help to reinforce deterrence.
Of course, non-state actors are harder to deter, so improved defenses such as pre-emption and human intelligence become important in such cases.
But, among states, even nuclear deterrence was more complex than it first looked, and that is doubly true of deterrence in the cyber domain.
Given its global nature, the Internet requires a degree of international cooperation to be able to function.
Some people call for the cyber equivalent of formal arms-control treaties.
But differences in cultural norms and the difficulty of verification would make such treaties hard to negotiate or implement.
At the same time, it is important to pursue international efforts to develop rules of the road that can limit conflict.
The most promising areas for international cooperation today most likely concern problems posed for states by third parties such as criminals and terrorists.
Russia and China have sought to establish a treaty establishing broad international oversight of the Internet and “information security,” which would prohibit deception and embedding malicious code or circuitry that could be activated in the event of war.
But the US has argued that arms-control measures banning offensive capabilities could weaken defenses against attacks and would be impossible to verify or enforce.
Likewise, in terms of political values, the US has resisted agreements that could legitimize authoritarian governments’ censorship of the Internet – for example, by the “great firewall of China.” Moreover, cultural differences impede any broad agreements on regulating online content.
Nonetheless, it may be possible to identify behaviors like cyber crime that are illegal in many domestic jurisdictions.
Trying to limit all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism involving non-state parties.
Here, major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls.
The transnational cyber domain poses new questions about the meaning of national security.
Some of the most important responses must be national and unilateral, focused on hygiene, redundancy, and resilience.
It is likely, however, that major governments will soon discover that the insecurity created by non-state cyber actors will require closer cooperation among governments.
A Global \
ATHENS – The International Monetary Fund’s belated admission that it significantly underestimated the damage that austerity would do to European Union growth rates highlights the self-defeating character of “orthodox” recipes to address the causes of the debt crisis that followed the financial crash of 2008-2009.
Conventional theory suggests that a single country (or group of countries) consolidating its finances can expect lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and an improved trade position.
But, because this cannot happen for all major economies simultaneously – one country’s (or group of countries’) austerity implies less demand for other countries’ products – such policies eventually lead to beggar-thy-neighbor situations.
Indeed, it was this dynamic – against which John Maynard Keynes fought – that made the Great Depression of the 1930’s so grim.
Today’s problems are compounded by a lack of sufficient private demand – particularly household consumption – in the advanced economies to compensate for demand losses stemming from austerity.
During the last two decades, consumption drove these countries’ economic growth, reaching historically high GDP shares.
Moreover, major advanced economies, such as the United States, Germany, and Japan, face longer-term fiscal problems in the form of aging populations or oversize welfare states, limiting their capacity to contribute to demand management.
Recent moves to ease monetary policy have been a step in the right direction; but, so far, they have not proved to be a game changer.
For domestic demand to act as an engine of growth, policies should shift resources from investment to consumption.
While the magnitudes involved are huge, they must be attained if an extended period of low growth, high unemployment, and declining living standards among the world’s poorest is to be avoided.
International economic policy coordination should be significantly strengthened in order to deal effectively with changes on such a scale.
Start with Europe.
It is by now patently obvious that austerity and domestic reforms are not enough to pull the eurozone’s periphery out of deep recession.
Growing awareness of the failure of current policies is causing social discontent, civil disorder, and political instability, with the recently concluded Italian elections and the growing popular resistance to Greek reform efforts serving as a bellwether.
Returning the eurozone’s peripheral economies to the path of growth requires more than structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.
It also requires a substantial reform of the monetary union’s system of economic governance, aimed at restoring financial stability and lowering borrowing costs, together with a boost in external demand in order to compensate for the effects of austerity.
Reforming governance implies significant progress toward economic unification: centralizing European debt through Eurobonds, mobilizing sufficient rescue funds, allowing the European Central Bank to intervene in the primary bond markets, and establishing both a fiscal and a banking union.
This is a tall order, in view of the reluctance of most EU member states to cede competences to European institutions.
But Europe should move more decisively in this direction.
Otherwise, speculation on member states’ national debt will persist, keeping borrowing costs at levels that are inconsistent with the conditions required to sustain economic recovery.
Concerning external demand, intra-European help in the form of reflationary policies in stronger economies is unlikely to prove sufficient, owing primarily to the fiscal and political conditions prevailing in Germany.
Implementing a Marshall Plan-type initiative by mobilizing EU budget resources and additional lending by the European Investment Bank to finance investments in weaker countries could be an alternative, but it lacks political support.
On a global scale, neither the US nor Japan is in a position to provide significant external stimulus.
Only the emerging and developing economies of Asia could effectively contribute to lifting global demand through a coordinated effort aimed at boosting domestic consumption, which, in turn, would stimulate additional investment.
Recent IMF experience suggests that, through appropriate coordination, private funds could be mobilized for big private-public partnership projects linking demand expansion with infrastructure investment.
In other words, a global “New Deal” – combining policies designed to achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide – seems to be required.
The advanced economies should promote productivity-enhancing structural reforms with renewed vigor.
The eurozone should solidify its currency union.
And the emerging and developing economies should support domestic sources of growth.
For such a deal to become possible, certain preconditions must be met.
First, international policy coordination by the G-20 must be tightened by creating a permanent secretariat to make policy proposals and recommendations concerning macroeconomic and financial developments.
The secretariat should actively cooperate with the IMF to benefit from its analysis, notably regarding exchange rates.
Second, global financial reform must proceed at a faster pace.
The financial sector requires tougher regulation, strengthened supervision, and internationally consistent resolution mechanisms to address the problems posed by very large, global institutions that are considered too big (or too complex) to fail.
Such reform is essential if the international financial system is to mediate the sizeable resource transfers that will underpin the required changes in the structure of global demand.
Finally, a new trade pact – possibly, but not necessarily, within the Doha Round – is needed to ensure the major trading powers’ access to foreign markets.
This is critically important for inspiring confidence in Asian countries, which might be persuaded to favor domestic, as opposed to external, sources of demand.
Moreover, trade liberalization will also increase consumer confidence worldwide.
The time is right for a new global settlement that targets growth, addresses crisis conditions in certain parts of the world, and rebalances the global economy to set it back on a path of strong and steady growth.
The Other Financial Crisis
NEWPORT BEACH – Two variants of financial crisis continue to wreak havoc on Western economies, fueling joblessness and poverty: the one that we read about regularly in newspapers, involving governments around the world; and a less visible one at the level of small and medium-size businesses and households.
Until both are addressed properly, the West will remain burdened by sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and excessive income and wealth inequality.
The sovereign-debt crisis is well known.
In order to avert a likely depression, governments around the world engaged in fiscal and monetary stimulus in the midst of the global financial crisis.
They succeeded in offsetting nasty economic dislocations caused by private-sector deleveraging, but at the cost of encumbering their fiscal balances and their central banks’ balance sheets.
While sovereign credit quality has deteriorated virtually across the board, and will most probably continue to do so, the implications for individual countries vary.
Some Western countries – such as Greece – had fragile government accounts from the outset and tipped quickly into persistent crisis mode.
There they remain, still failing to provide citizens with a light at the end of what already has been a long tunnel.
Other countries had been fiscally responsible, but were overwhelmed by the liabilities that they had assumed from others (for example, Ireland’s irresponsible banks sank their budget).
Still others, including the United States, faced no immediate threat but failed to make progress on longer-term issues.&nbsp;A few, like Germany, had built deep economic and financial resilience through years of fiscal discipline and structural reforms.
It is not surprising that policy approaches have also varied.
Indeed, they have shared only one, albeit crucial (and disappointing) feature: the inability to rely on rapid growth as the “safest” way to deleverage an over-indebted economy.
Greece essentially defaulted on some obligations.
Ireland opted for austerity and reforms, as has the United Kingdom.
The US is gradually transferring resources from creditors to debtors through financial repression.
And Germany is slowly acquiescing to a prudent relative expansion in domestic demand.
So much for the sovereign-debt crisis, which, given its national, regional, and global impact, has been particularly well covered.
After all, sovereigns are called that because they have the power to impose taxes, regulations, and, at the extreme, confiscation.
But the other credit crisis is equally consequential, and receives much less attention, even as it erodes societies’ integrity, productive capabilities, and ability to maintain living standards (particularly for the least fortunate).
I know of very few Western countries where small and medium-size companies, as well as middle-income households and those of more limited means, have not experienced a significant decline in their access to credit – not just new financing, but also the ability to roll over old credit lines and loans.
The immediate causes are well known.
They range from subdued bank lending to unusually high risk aversion, and from discredited credit vehicles to the withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermediation altogether.
Such credit constraints are one reason why unemployment rates continue to rise in so many countries – often from already alarming levels, such as 25% in Greece and Spain (where youth unemployment is above 50%) – and why unemployment remains unusually high in countries like the US (albeit it at a much lower level).
This is not just a matter of lost capabilities and rising poverty; persistently high unemployment also leads to social unrest, erosion of trust in political leaders and institutions, and the mounting risk of a lost generation.
Indeed, unemployment data in many advanced countries are dominated by long-term joblessness (usually defined as six months or more).
Skill erosion becomes a problem for those with prior work experience, while unsuccessful first-time entrants into the labor force are not just unemployed, but risk becoming unemployable.
Governments are doing too little to address the private credit debacle.
Arguably, they must first sort out the sovereign side of the crisis; but it is not clear that most officials even have a comprehensive plan.
Policy asymmetry is greatest for the countries most acutely affected by the sovereign-debt crisis.
There, the private sector has essentially been left to fend for itself; and most households and companies are struggling, thus fueling continued economic implosion.
Other countries appear to have adopted a “Field of Dreams” – also known as “build it and they will come” – approach to private credit markets, In the US, for example, artificially low interest rates for home mortgages, resulting from the Federal Reserve’s policy activism, are supposed to kick-start prudent financing.
The European Central Bank is taking a similarly indirect approach.
In both places, other policymaking entities, with much better tools at their disposal, appear either unwilling or unable to play their part.
As such, action by central banks will repeatedly fail to gain sufficient traction.
In fact, only the UK is visibly opting for a more coordinated and direct way to counter the persistent shortfalls stemming from the private part of the credit crisis.
There, the “Funding for Lending Scheme,” jointly designed by the Bank of England and the Treasury, seeks “to boost the incentive for banks and building societies to lend to UK households and non-financial companies,” while holding them accountable for proper behavior.
The UK example is important; but, given the scope and scale of the challenges, the proposal is a relatively modest one.
The program may stimulate some productive credit intermediation, but it will not make a significant dent in what will remain one of the major obstacles to robust economic recovery.
Proper access to credit for productive segments is an integral part of a well-functioning economy.
Without it, growth falters, job creation is insufficient, and widening income and wealth inequality undermines the social fabric.
That is why any comprehensive approach to restoring the advanced countries’ economic and financial vibrancy must target the proper revival of private credit flows.
A Rest Stop for Europe
PRINCETON – Last week, in a highly anticipated speech, German President Joachim Gauck cautioned against the blind pursuit of an “ever-closer” European Union, acknowledging that the growing inequality among member states is generating “a sense of unease, even unmistakable anger,” and increasing the risk of national humiliation.
He pointed out that, in addition to the economic crisis, there is “a crisis of confidence in Europe as a political project.”
While Gauck made clear that he remains decidedly pro-Europe, he highlighted the need for closer reflection about Europe’s future – and especially that of the eurozone.
Standing on the verge of greater integration, Europeans are hesitant, “unsure whether we should really stride out on the onward journey.” Addressing this hesitation, he declared, will require a thoughtful, nuanced understanding of what “more Europe” actually means.
Gauck may not have gone far enough: At this point, an ever-closer union may be a political mirage.
Any meaningful progress toward stabilizing the eurozone would require a significant – potentially open-ended – financial commitment, and the EU is not politically ready to cross that threshold.
Repeatedly pretending to move forward, then pulling back at the critical point, exacerbates political uncertainty and economic vulnerability.
Rather than indecisively pursuing more unity, this may be the moment to restore effective sovereignty to national authorities in eurozone countries.
Such a move would alleviate anxiety in the short term, thereby giving Europeans the opportunity to regroup in preparation for future steps toward a more integrated Europe and a more resilient euro.
To this end, eurozone leaders must take three key steps.
The dysfunctional system of European fiscal governance should be dismantled; fiscal responsibility should be returned to member states; and, to minimize the risk of excessive future lending, private lenders should be required to bear the losses implied by unsustainable sovereign debt.
The case against European fiscal governance is straightforward.
Before the crisis, the single-minded emphasis on reducing national budget deficits to less than 3% of GDP led to extensive abuse.
Either the target was openly flouted, as it was in leading economies like Germany and France, or the data were manipulated to obscure problems (a common practice throughout the eurozone, not just in Greece).
And the belief in economic growth as a fiscal panacea led to unrealistically optimistic GDP forecasts.
When the crisis struck, the 3% deficit target became the focal point for unrelenting austerity – a form of what anthropologist Clifford Geertz described as “involution,” which occurs when a process intensifies rather than changes in response to external or internal pressure.
In other words, EU leaders began to complicate fiscal governance, ultimately creating an inefficient, inescapable labyrinth of regulation and bureaucracy.
As fiscal metrics become increasingly intricate, monitoring efforts will become ever easier to undermine.
The case for returning fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also strong – and not only because centralized fiscal authority has proved to be so inefficient.
With citizens of distressed countries bearing the fiscal burden of the crisis, the enduring presumption that they will not act responsibly is patronizing, at best.
And the current strategy of exchanging goodies for good behavior encourages game-playing and dilutes responsibility.
While the risk that governments will succumb to fiscal temptation remains, citizens’ current suffering is likely to deter future excesses.
National fiscal sovereignty would facilitate the final crucial step: building a more mature relationship with private lenders.
The eurozone was founded on the “no bailout” principle: if member states could not repay their debts, lenders would bear the losses.
But lenders chose – correctly, as it turned out – to disregard that threat.
Instead of enforcing the no-bailout principle and establishing a precedent, debtor countries used official loans to repay private creditors.
As a result, these countries have condemned themselves to continued austerity, low growth, and high debt, while diminishing any future incentive for private lenders to impose fiscal discipline on sovereign borrowers.
Only by shifting the burden of responsibility back onto private lenders can debtor countries escape this quagmire.
In the United States, each state is responsible for its fiscal management, without being forced to comply with a single, overarching template.
The states are not regulated by the federal government; they are disciplined by the knowledge that no one will repay their debts for them.
And the system seems to work: entering the crisis, US states had significantly lower deficit and debt ratios than the eurozone’s vulnerable member states.
So far, European integration has largely been a process of “falling forward,” with each stumble serving as a lesson from which a stronger union emerges.
But, while this uncertain approach may suffice as a basis for declarations of good intentions, it does not inspire the confidence required for countries to make the profound financial commitment that is now needed.
Europeans should have the chance to regain their footing.
Transferring fiscal responsibility back to national authorities would not only mean the end of counterproductive efforts to manage fiscal affairs centrally; it would also diminish the sense of frustration and lack of control that is fueling Euro-skepticism.
In short, taking a step back would provide an opportunity to reset, to reflect, and to plot the best course toward a more stable, more integrated Europe.
For a fiscal union to function – however unlikely that outcome may be – a solid foundation is crucial.
As Gauck explained, Europeans “are pausing to… equip [themselves] both intellectually and emotionally for the next step, which will require [them] to enter uncharted territory.”
Giving Europeans the time and space to choose more Europe would reinforce the core values upon which integration has rested for more than six decades.
Continuing to stumble forward, however, would inevitably lead to a debilitating, if not fatal, fall.
Advise and Relent
WASHINGTON, DC – Dropping bombs as a solution to the world’s trouble spots may be falling out of fashion (with the notable exception of Libya), but finger wagging is definitely back in.
Hardly a day goes by without a major newspaper somewhere in the West offering sage and specific, but often not-so-friendly, advice to distant struggling democracies on what they “must” do to earn the “international community’s” approbation.
Of course, such advice, like much of newspapers themselves nowadays, comes free of charge.
But it is also advice that is free of responsibility, and, as Stanley Baldwin once said, power without responsibility is the prerogative of the harlot.
There is a considerable gap between offers of advice one cannot refuse and the responsibility to deal with the consequences when that advice proves wrong or extremely difficult to implement.
The world’s advice givers might try to keep this in mind when offering to help leaders of distant countries that are grappling with problems with which the adviser has little or no first-hand experience.
Every once in a while, a profession (most frequently, economics) determines that it has reached a consensus on how to solve a problem.
The so-called “Washington Consensus” that held sway before the recent financial crisis was a good example.
In the case of nascent democracies, the formula that is now often made compulsory is this: lift all bans on political activities, liberalize the media, hold elections (the sooner, the better), resolve all minority issues in favor of the minorities, abandon trade barriers, and rid the country of corruption, preferably overnight.
New governments are urged to tackle all of these problems immediately and simultaneously, lest they lose “momentum” and begin backsliding.
The subtext is clear: be like us now.
How to do this is left up to the new leaders, who are often credited with goodness and powers of persuasion they never had and never will have.
In many cases, the cohesiveness of opposition movements that come to power in the wake of a political upheaval may not be what the international media presume it to be.
Indeed, some components of these so-called “democratic coalitions” may not be democratic at all.
Some leaders, such as Nelson Mandela, rise to the historic occasion, against all odds.
Others, such as Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev (popular with Western media when he first came on the scene) plainly has not.
How can we help ensure these movements’ sustainability in such fluid moments?
Modesty is a virtue in private life.
It should also be a guide in dispensing political advice.
I would start by keeping in mind that some countries’ capacity to absorb advice is limited, so it should be offered in smaller portions.
Where to start?
The most important and potentially sustaining feature of a new democracy lies in its effort to commit itself to observing international human-rights standards.
In fact, there is a large body of literature that indicates that even countries in the aftermath of internal conflict can reach a higher level of compliance with these standards.
But human rights should not be conflated with democracy.
While democracy is, no doubt, the form of governance that best preserves human rights, the two are not the same thing.
Human rights will not co-exist with dictatorship, or with any other non-democracy, for long.
Setting standards and goals of human rights is a powerful signal that a country is pointing itself in the right direction.
The country is in effect announcing that it is moving toward democratic institutional arrangements.
Banning torture, complying with international standards of prisoners’ rights, and enshrining rights of association and public assembly all immediately come to mind.
The embrace of essential human-rights standards as a cornerstone of a country’s development is one of our era’s seminal innovations.
The notion that a dictator can claim the sovereign right to abuse his people has become unacceptable.
A country that makes progress on human rights and commits to the change of behavior required to meet these international standards can also make a decisive turn toward a better future.
We should therefore focus on meeting international human-rights standards as a goal that a new democracy “must” (to use a favorite word of Western editorial writers) move toward quickly.
But we should not confuse these values with the other essential elements of progress, such as establishing liberalized trade regimes, creating institutional structures with a separation of powers, and rooting out corruption.
These are absolute necessities for democratic success, but they require longer-term development of institutional capacity.
Corruption, for example, may have cultural antecedents and is part and parcel of institutional weakness.
In most cases, neither can be remedied overnight.
Above all, we need to show patience with the new governments of the countries we hope to see evolving toward democracy, and avoid the tendency to expect instant gratification.
A few months of politics will never overcome a few centuries of sociology.
So, as we watch and wait, we need to be as supportive – but not overbearing – as possible.
Affirmative Action for Europe
The violence in France, fueled by staggering unemployment and ruthless policing, reflects the utter failure of the French model of social integration.
But violence elsewhere in Europe, such as the London bombings of July and the brutal murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh on the streets of Amsterdam in November 2004, had already made Europe’s failure to integrate its minorities painfully clear.
As the riots in France fade, French politicians are agonizing about how to proceed.
Forty years ago, after legal segregation of blacks and whites formally ended in America, the United States was confronted by similar problems.
America’s response shows, however, that integration cannot be viewed as a one-way street.
In addition to imposing demands and constraints on minorities to join the mainstream, society must be willing to demand of itself that it make room for all its citizens.
As a potential model to be followed, Europe should look at the so-called “affirmative action” policies that America enacted to provide opportunities to blacks.
Affirmative action, or “positive discrimination,” as some have called these policies, began with university admissions.
But, in the early 1970’s, President Richard M. Nixon expanded the scope of affirmative action.
As a result, ethnicity began to be weighed as a positive factor not only in university admissions, but also in public procurement decisions, credit facilities for small enterprises, and government hiring.
The rational for affirmative action in those early years was the fact that, after a long history of systemic injustice, merely outlawing discrimination based on race or gender would not ensure equal opportunity for all.
Such programs are often viewed as contradicting a basic American value, namely that admissions, lending, and hiring decisions should be based on the merits of the individual, not group distinctions.
But they remain in existence three decades later.
Indeed, leading American companies, like General Motors, General Electric, and Walmart, have created affirmative action programs for hiring and selecting suppliers at their own initiative.
Similarly, anchormen and anchorwomen from all ethnic backgrounds populate American television news programs.
In France, by contrast, the appointment of the black anchorwoman Audrey Pulvar was big news on its own, because most of her colleagues in France are white.
Affirmative action in the US has been effective in creating a large African-American middle class.
The percentage of black households earning over $50,000 a year (adjusted for inflation) has more than tripled over the last four decades, from 9.1% in 1967 to 27.8% in 2001.
Indeed, in the US, more people of color and women hold top jobs in the public and private sector than anywhere else in the world.
The fact that a large black underclass remains – something the recent floods in New Orleans revealed in a horrifically dramatic way – is mainly the result of failing school systems.
Affirmative action programs, of course, have always been vulnerable to attack by those who can’t benefit from them.
In 2003, a white student asked the US Supreme Court to declare that the use of race in the University of Michigan’s admission policies violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.
The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the program was constitutional, citing a “compelling state interest” in racial diversity.
“Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civil life of our nation,” the court said, “is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized.”
In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court took into account a legal brief submitted by 60 major American businesses, led by General Motors, asking that affirmative action be upheld.
They argued that the skills needed in today’s global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to a wide diversity of people.
Retired military officers and commanders told the court that affirmative action was essential to maintaining an integrated officer corps.
What America’s affirmative action programs may not do is set quotas for minorities, as this prevents competition between different groups.
But, in comparing groups, it is permitted to use an individual’s status as member of an under-represented minority in his or her favor.
As a result, a university may select a black student with a satisfactory score on the admissions test, even if there is a white student with a better score.
From the current French viewpoint, however, laws and regulations based on ethnicity are regarded as an unwelcome encroachment on the Republican ideal.
French President Jacques Chirac vehemently opposes quotas for immigrants, out of fear that such a policy would stigmatize groups.
And French businesses don’t see it as their role to solve the problems of the suburbs.
Moreover, French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy hasn’t done much except hand out some special grants to the smartest immigrants from the suburbs.
France does have affirmative action programs, but they address poverty, not ethnicity.
If European politicians are serious about preventing a schism between population groups, affirmative action is essential – not only at the workplace, but also for small business loans, home loans, public procurement, and school admissions.
Tony Blair, who in July was faced with the shortcomings of integration in the UK, should take advantage of the country’s current presidency of the European Union to make affirmative action programs the top priority at next month’s summit of European government leaders in Brussels.
Afghanistan’s Customary Anguish
FARAH, AFGHANISTAN –When the problems riddling Afghan society are listed – violence, insecurity, corruption, religious fundamentalism – one dominating factor is usually left out: the influence of customary law.
In Afghanistan, there are three principal legal references: constitutional law, the Koran, and the system of customary law known asFarhang, the most dominant and strictest version of which is calledPashtunwali (the way of the Pashtuns).
Originally an ancient honor code,Farhang ensures the dominance of the oldest male of any household, followed by married sons, unmarried sons, and grandsons, then wives (with the youngest at the bottom).
Collective decisions are taken by patriarchs in councils calledjirgas, where all have to be in agreement.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });This agreement includes including collaborating or not with the Taliban, cooperating with the Coalition forces, accepting or refusing poppy eradication in a village.
Everything else is left to patriarchal discretion. Here, no one will intervene except to reinforce the application of the patriarch's rights – say, in stoning a supposedly wayward girl, or turning a blind eye to so-called “honor killings” of women.
Every act of an Afghan male’s life is integrated in a form of reciprocity, in which nothing is free.Melmastia, the basic tenet of hospitality means “I will give you shelter if you ask me to, even if you are a fugitive murderer; but, in exchange, you fight my battles.” This sense of customary obligation is why so many of President Hamid Karzai’s cronies remain in place and Taliban leaders remain safe.
Women are excluded from collective decision-making, as they are mere objects.
Girls are literally sold upon marriage (the father is paid money for his daughter’s labor and reproductive capacity) and join their husband’s household.
The younger the girl, the higher the price.
Marriage, especially in the provinces, is routinely consummated on pre-pubescent bodies.
Yet women are precious in their own way.
A family’s principal “cultural capital” is its honor, which is ensured by denying women any opportunity to highlight male failings and therefore tarnish clan respectability.
As a result, women must be strictly secluded and made invisible when in public, for they are personally responsible for the desire that they could ignite in schools, hospitals, parks, or markets.
The all-covering burqa ensures sufficient anonymity to permit women a certain amount of freedom in public space.
Every female simultaneously carries her father’s and her husband’s honor, and will stoically submit to all forms of violence committed in its name.
This may mean dying in childbirth rather than risking the “dishonor” of giving birth in a public place, a hospital, in front of strangers.
Going to court is practically unheard of, as it would mean renouncing family practices.
From the male point of view, resorting to outside police or judicial intervention would signify an inability to fight one’s own battles – an admission of defeat and a symbolic castration.
This helps explain the intense corruption present in Afghan courts, where “honor” can be redeemed by bribing a judge to have a rapist or murderer released.
As violence is strictly a private matter, relinquishing justice to state institutions could be an unacceptable humiliation.
Customary law is not rigid in that it is made to fit round the demands of global economy.
It has become more rigorous in it s applications due to the influence ofmilitant Islam, which seeks to use religious texts to legitimize escalating brutality, especially against women.
However,Farhang and privatized violence are precisely what Mohammad sought to ban through Koranic law, which went beyond the personal domain and instituted a code that gave some rights to women.
For example, while the Koran allows for a measure of female inheritance, tribal custom does not authorize it, which explains the popularity of tribal councils to resolve inheritance problems and cheat women out of their rights.
Similarly, whereas the Koran requires four eyewitnesses as proof of adultery, mere suspicion of some unregulated, potentially sexual conduct by a woman warrants stoning under customary law.
Yet an awareness of alternatives is seeping in through the media, even in remote provinces.
Iranian films and the much loved Indian TV serials, not to mention the occasional American film, influence peoples' expectations.
Add to that the experience of having lived abroad as refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
Girls know that there are options to an unacceptable way of life: women are increasingly demanding more from life than what custom ordains.
This is especially true for those who have lived in Iran, a totally Muslim environment that allows women the freedom to study and work as well as access to adequate healthcare and family planning.
Once back in rural Afghanistan, forced into brutal marriages, many desperate women – especially returnees from Iran – resort to self-immolation.
Violence and murder of women are on the increase, perpetrated by men who feel that these alternatives pose a threat to their authority.
The West imagines that religion is the central issue in Afghanistan.
But the heart of the matter is the preservation of ancient patriarchal rights that go back to Biblical times, reformatted to fit the demands of globalized capitalism.
Governments and international aid organizations have failed to take into consideration the role ofFarhang, perhaps because the power of unwritten law remains largely inconceivable in the West.
But Afghanistan cannot begin to solve its many problems until it criminalizes the privatized violence of this antiquated code.
Afghanistan’s Feminist Revolution
On April 16, more than 300 Afghani women – many of them students – marched together in Kabul in protest of a new law passed by Parliament that would impose a series of Taliban-like restrictions on women.
The law would permit marital rape, limit women’s movements – say, for work or study – without male permission, and even make it illegal for a woman to refuse to dress as her husband wishes.
The women, facing a crowd of furious men calling them “whores” and other epithets, marched two miles under a rain of abuse and delivered their petition against the law to legislators.
Both houses of Parliament had approved the law, and President Hamid Karzai signed it.
The law now affects only the Shia minority, but threatens to affect pending legislation that could restrict the rights of non-Shia women as well.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });When Western media sought quotes from the women, they frequently heard a Western-style feminist refrain: “These laws would make women into a kind of property.”
In the West, the counterpoint to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individualistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman’s own wishes, rather than as wife, mother, community member, or worshipper.
But, while some Western feminist insights may be useful to Afghani women and other women in the developing world as they resist certain forms of male oppression, we should not assume – as Western feminists often have – that our job is to proselytize “our” feminism.
On the contrary, the feminism expressed by women such as these Afghani heroines should educate us in the West about our own shortcomings.
The core theory with which emerging feminists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of Western feminism – and in some ways far more profound and humane.
In India, for example, feminists articulated to me a vision of women’s equality that was family-centered rather than self-centered, and that valued service to community rather than personal gratification.
They did not see their struggle as a cultural or ideological clash between men and women, but rather as a very practical effort to live free from violence and sexual assault, forced child marriage and bride-burning, and legal exclusion from parity.
The emerging consensus in India in support of greater rights and freedoms for women, while certainly causing some upheaval and adjustment (especially within the growing middle classes) has not yet – and might never – poison the basic trust and warmth between men and women.
Nor does it seem likely to emulate the splintered, individualized, solitary society – and the commodified sexual revolution – that Western, self-based feminism reflects.
This version of feminism – the notion that women can claim equality and still have a valued role in the home, prize family above all, and view rights in the context of community and spirituality – seems like a much-needed corrective to some of Western feminism’s shortcomings.
Ideally, men’s drive for progress in the developing world would also evolve, uniting the idea of the autonomous self with support for family, community, and other ties, and Western men would learn from this as well.
Moreover, intellectually, these women remind us that Western feminism did not have to evolve the way it did, and can still change and grow to embrace a more satisfying and humane definition of equality.
Simone de Beauvoir, whose seminal bookThe Second Sex laid the groundwork for post-war Western feminism, was an Existentialist who was neither a wife nor a mother nor a woman of faith.
So her work naturally posited female freedom in a secular, solitary, and individualistic context, in which “freedom” means pure autonomy rather than integration within a whole – comprising family, community, and even God – on equal terms.
The good news for all women, East and West, is that President Karzai, under intense international criticism – and not just Western criticism – changed the law less than one week after the march.
This global uproar is a testament to how three decades of Western feminist challenges to leadership have changed the world for the better.
But our (Western) moment of feminist leadership is over now – for good reasons.
We know by now what our problems are as women in the West, and we know the blueprint for solving them. What we lack now is not analysis, but the organizational and political will to do so.
So the leadership role is shifting to women in the developing world.
Their agenda is more pressing, and their problems, frankly, far more serious than ours, which makes it much more urgent for them to develop theories appropriate to the challenges they face.
If one of those courageous Afghan women who marched in Kabul wrote – as I hope she or one of her sisters in the developing world is doing right now – the seminal text for the next 50 years on non-Western feminism, it would no doubt be equality-driven and practical.
And perhaps, in its likely view of the world as being more than the sum of consuming, competing autonomies, or gender warfare, it would be a valuable challenge to truisms that we Western feminists – and the men who love us – have thought we had to take for granted.
Afghanistan’s Opium War
When NATO leaders meet for their summit in Riga at the end of this month, there will be a ghost at the feast: Afghanistan’s opium.
Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into the hands of terrorists, insurgents, and criminals, and the multi-billion-dollar opium trade is at the heart of the country’s malaise.
Indeed, NATO’s top general, James Jones, has called drugs the “Achilles heel” of Afghanistan.
This year’s record harvest of 6,100 tons of opium will generate more than $3 billion in illicit revenue – equivalent to almost half of Afghanistan’s GDP.
Profits for drug traffickers downstream will be almost 20 times that amount.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Opium money is corrupting Afghan society from top to bottom.
High-level collusion enables thousands of tons of chemical precursors, needed to produce heroin, to be trucked into the country.
Armed convoys transport raw opium around the country unhindered. Sometimes even army and police vehicles are involved.
Guns and bribes ensure that the trucks are waved through checkpoints.
Opiates flow freely across borders into Iran, Pakistan, and other Central Asian countries.
The opium fields of wealthy landowners are untouched, because local officials are paid off.
Major traffickers never come to trial because judges are bribed or intimidated.
Senior government officials take their cut of opium revenues or bribes in return for keeping quiet.
Perversely, some provincial governors and government officials are themselves major players in the drug trade.
As a result, the Afghan state is at risk of takeover by a malign coalition of extremists, criminals, and opportunists. Opium is choking Afghan society.
Within Afghanistan, drug addiction is rising.
Neighbors that used to be transit states for drugs are now major consumers, owing to similar dramatic increases in opium and heroin addiction.
Intravenous drug use is spreading HIV/AIDS in Iran, Central Asia, and the former Soviet Union.
In traditional Western European markets, health officials should brace for a rise in the number of deaths from drug overdoses, as this year’s bumper opium crop will lead to higher-purity doses of heroin.
What can be done?
First, the veil of corruption in Afghanistan must be lifted.
Afghans are fed up with arrogant and well-armed tycoons who live in mansions and drive top-of-the range Mercedes limousines – this in a country where barely 13% of the population have electricity and most people must survive on less than $200 a year.
It is time for the Afghan government to name, shame, and sack corrupt officials, arrest major drug traffickers and opium landlords, and seize their assets.
Donors have trained police and prosecutors and built courts and detention centers.
Now it is up to the government to use the judicial system to impose the rule of law.
It will be difficult, but not impossible, to re-establish confidence in the central government. Putting major drug traffickers behind bars at the new maximum-security prison at Pul-i-Charki, near Kabul, would be a good start.
Of course, Afghanistan does not bear sole responsibility for its plight.
The heroin trade would not be booming if Western governments were serious about combating drug consumption.
It is a bitter irony that the countries whose soldiers’ lives are on the line in Afghanistan are also the biggest markets for Afghan heroin.
Furthermore, Afghanistan’s neighbors must do more to stop insurgents, weapons, money, and chemical precursors from flowing across their borders into the country.
Coalition forces should take a more robust approach to the drug problem. Counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics are two sides of the same coin.
Improving security and the rule of law must include destroying the opium trade.
Allowing opium traffickers to operate with impunity gives them a free hand to raise money to pay for the arms and fighters battling the Afghan army and NATO forces.
The United Nations Security Council has authorized the International Security Assistance Force to take all necessary measures to fulfill its mandate.
NATO troops should be given the green light to help the Afghan army fight opium – destroy the heroin labs, disband the opium bazaars, attack the opium convoys, and bring the big traders to justice.
And they should be given the tools and manpower to do the job.
There is no point in trying to win the hearts and minds of major drug traffickers.
Farmers are a different story.
Forced eradication risks pushing farmers into the hands of extremists, and thus will not lead to the sustainable reduction of opium fields. Indeed, as we have seen in some Andean countries, it can be counter-productive.
Therefore, security and development must go hand in hand.
To achieve this, Afghanistan needs more development assistance.
International support so far has been generous, but it is still well below per capita equivalents for other post-conflict situations – and the need is much greater.
Farmers will be weaned off opium over the long term only if they have sustainable livelihoods.
At the moment, Afghanistan’s drug lords are prospering, and rural communities are suffering.
That situation needs to be reversed. We must punish the traffickers and reward the farmers.
We cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan.
Recent history has given us graphic evidence of what would happen if we do.
But any solution in Afghanistan depends on eliminating its opium.
Afghanistan’s Terrorized Women
KABUL – Recently, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) office in Kudoz province reported the rescue of a young woman who had been imprisoned in her in-laws’ dungeon for seven months.
Fifteen-year-old Sahar Gul was forced to marry an older man who serves in the Afghan army.
She was then kept in the dungeon by her husband’s family and brutally tortured for months, because she refused to work as a prostitute.
Over the past ten years, the AIHRC has received more than 19,000 complaints related to violence against women.
Despite making some progress in investigating the complaints and referring them to the justice system, as well as in raising public awareness about the issue, the challenges remain huge.
Since 2002, many efforts have been made to improve women’s lives in Afghanistan.
The country has enacted several new laws and established a fairly advanced legal framework to end discrimination against women, including a new law that criminalizes any act that results in violence against women.
But laws and policies alone are not sufficient to protect women from horrific domestic abuse.
Indeed, the Gul case is hardly the only well-publicized case.
There was also Gulnaz, a young woman who was jailed for adultery after being raped by a relative (she was recently released after a presidential pardon, but may be forced to marry her attacker).
The husband of another young woman, Aisha, cut off her nose and ears when she ran away.
Violence against women in Afghanistan persists for many reasons.
First, the country has inherited a patriarchal tribal tradition that assumes women’s inferiority. Women are therefore deprived of their basic rights and freedoms.
Second, there is a strong political incentive to deprive women of their rights.
Radical groups receive immense support from the large share of the population that opposes women’s rights.
The Taliban, for example, have consistently used an anti-women policy to appeal to tribal and rural people.
Third, family pride and honor are deemed more important than a woman’s individual well-being and safety.
For example, if family members beat or abuse a woman, she has few options.
Often, her only choice is to remain silent or risk disgracing the family.
If she does report the matter to the authorities, the case will almost certainly never be properly investigated, nor the perpetrators ever prosecuted.
Gul, for example, complained to the police about her abusive in-laws, but she was returned to the family when some of their influential contacts intervened.
Fourth, laws are often arbitrarily applied, and sharia (Islamic law) frequently takes precedence over civil legislation, resulting in widespread impunity for crimes of violence against women.
For example, in October 2010, the Afghan Supreme Court ruled that women who run away from home can be charged with prostitution, unless they go to the police or an immediate relative's home.&#160;It is this mindset that led to Gul’s victimization.
Finally, while the Taliban lost power ten years ago, discrimination and violence against women has occurred in Afghan society for centuries.
Thus, despite some progress, public and official sensitivity to violence against women is only slowly emerging.
The Afghan government must take several steps to protect women fully.
Above all, perpetrators of violence against women should be prosecuted and tried under due process of law.
This will require strengthening the rule of law and ending the prevailing culture of impunity.
That, in turn, requires educating the public further about human rights and women’s rights through school textbooks, continuing education courses, and a vigorous media campaign.
It also requires persuading representatives and policymakers to develop policies and allocate budget revenues to combat violence against women, and training police and judges to handle cases of violence against women without deferring to claims of family honor.
Perhaps most importantly, non-constitutional justice systems, such as sharia, must be monitored and checked, if not prohibited altogether.
As for Sahar Gul, her case must be thoroughly investigated, and the police and judiciary must commit to bringing her torturers to justice.
Furthermore, Gul’s case, and others like it, should be studied in order to understand the roots of such crimes.
Until Afghanistan’s leaders begin to address this problem seriously, our country will continue to bear the scar of violence against women on its face.
Africa, Climate Change, and the G-8 Summit
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the G-8 Summit this July will be African poverty and global climate change.
These may seem to be distinct issues.
In fact, they are linked.
A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why.
One morning, I was taken to a dry riverbed at the village’s edge.
Farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed, down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level.
They explained that until recently this was a perennial river – one that flows throughout the year – but now the river stops flowing during the dry season.
Only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed.
Until then, water-starved communities dig for water, if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out.
In northern Ethiopia, as in much of Africa, the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years.
Ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops, one during a short rain in March and April, and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months.
In recent years, the short rains have failed entirely, and long rains have been erratic.
Hunger is omnipresent.
Perhaps half of the children are severely underweight.
Much of arid sub-Saharan Africa, notably in the Sahel (the region just south of the Sahara desert), has experienced a pronounced drop in rainfall over the past quarter-century.
This decline coincided with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighboring Indian Ocean, a hint that the decline in rainfall is in fact part of the longer-term process of man-made global warming.
Failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger, but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water.
When violence erupts in water-starved regions such as Darfur, Sudan, political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms.
If they act at all, they mobilize peacekeepers, international sanctions, and humanitarian aid.
But Darfur, like Tigre, needs a development strategy to fight hunger and drought even more than it needs peacekeepers.
Soldiers cannot keep peace among desperately hungry people.
One course of action must be to help impoverished African regions to “adapt” to climate change and to escape the poverty trap.
Water-stressed regions like Ethiopia and Sudan can adapt, at least in part, through improved technologies such as “drip irrigation,” rainwater harvesting, improved water storage facilities, deep wells, and agro-forestry techniques that make best use of scarce rainfall.
Better land-management practices (the re-planting of degraded forests, for example) can recharge underground water aquifers.
Poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own.
Nor should they have to.
Help for poor countries in Africa and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as charity or aid, but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet.
Greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered.
In addition to adapting to climate change, the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases, which are the source of man-made climate change.
While adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough.
If the world fails to mitigate future climate change, the effects of rising temperatures, increasing droughts, more numerous and severe tropical storms, rising sea levels, and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet.
The famines in Ethiopia and the violence in Darfur suggest what can lie ahead.
The best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions.
There are at least three options: shift to non-carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy; capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide emitted at carbon-based power plants; economize on energy use, for example by shifting to hybrid automobiles and trucks.
Most likely, all three of these methods will have to play a role.
The effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action, but, given the long lead times in overhauling the world’s energy systems, we must start now.
Rich countries need to lead the way.
It is ironic that the United States, which portrays itself as a friend of democracy and impoverished countries, gives the smallest share of its GNP in aid among the rich countries, and also refuses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
This is especially ironic because African countries like Ethiopia stand steadfastly and bravely with the US in the fight for freedom and against terrorism, even as they struggle with hunger, disease, and famine.
Moreover, countries like Ethiopia are making valiant, indeed remarkable, efforts to overcome their problems, despite the lack of adequate, and long-promised, help from the world’s richest countries.
Africans suffering from hunger and drought, and indeed poor people everywhere, have a right to ask much more of the US and other rich countries.
Tony Blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises.
Africa at Risk
ADDIS ABABA – Climate change will hit Africa – a continent that has contributed virtually nothing to bring it about – first and hardest.
Aside from Antarctica, Africa is the only continent that has not industrialized.
Indeed, since 1980’s the industrialization that had taken place in Africa has by and large been reversed.
Africa has thus contributed nothing to the historical accumulation of greenhouse gases through carbon-based industrialization.
Moreover, its current contribution is also negligible, practically all of it coming from deforestation and degradation of forests and farmland.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Yet climate change will hit Africa hardest, because it will cripple the continent’s vulnerable agricultural sector, on which 70% of the population depends.
All estimates of the possible impact of global warming suggest that a large part of the continent will become drier, and that the continent as a whole will experience greater climatic variability.
We know what the impact of periodic droughts have been on the lives of tens of millions of Africans.
We can therefore imagine what the impact of a drier climate on agriculture is likely to be.
Conditions in this vital economic sector will become even more precarious than they currently are.
Africa will not only be hit hardest, but it will be hit first.
Indeed, the long dreaded impact of climate change is already upon us.
The current drought covering much of East Africa – far more severe than past droughts – has been directly associated with climate change.
The upcoming climate negotiations ought to address the specific problems of Africa and similarly vulnerable poor parts of the world.
This requires, first and most importantly, reducing global warming to the apparently inevitable increase of two degrees Celsius, beyond which lies an environmental catastrophe that could be unmanageable for poor and vulnerable countries.
Second, adequate resources should be made available to poor and vulnerable regions and countries to enable them to adapt to climate change.
Climate change, which was largely brought about by the activities of developed countries, has made it difficult for poor and vulnerable countries to fight poverty.
It has created a more hostile environment for development.
No amount of money will undo the damage done.
But adequate investment in mitigating the damage could partly resolve the problem.
Developed countries are thus morally obliged to pay partial compensation to poor and vulnerable countries and regions to cover part of the cost of the investments needed to adapt to climate change.
Various estimates have been made of the scale of investment required by those countries.
One conservative estimate – which has a reasonable chance of being accepted precisely because it is conservative – calls for $50 billion per year as of 2015, increasing to $100 billion by 2020 and beyond.
A transitional financing arrangement would be put in place for the period 2010-2015.
Some argue that developed countries cannot come up with such sums, particularly given their current economic challenges.
But no one has so far argued that the cost of damage caused to the development prospects of poor countries and regions is less than the amount of compensation being offered to cover adjustment costs.
The reason is obvious: the damage caused is many times higher than the compensation being requested.
Nonetheless, it is argued, whatever the real cost of the damage, developed countries currently cannot afford to provide that kind of money.
But we all know that these countries and their national banks were able to spend trillions of dollars in a few months to bail out their bankers, who earned super-profits when the going was good.
When the good times ended, taxpayers and governments were prepared to rescue them and to ensure that they continued to receive their extraordinary bonuses.
If the developed world is able to pay trillions of dollars to clean up its bankers’ mess, how is it possible that it cannot afford to pay billions of dollars to clean up a mess that it created, and that is threatening the survival of whole continents?
Clearly this is not about the availability of resources.
It is about the inappropriate priorities in how resources are allocated.
It is about moral values that make it appropriate to rescue bankers, who expect everyone but themselves to pay for the mess they created, and inappropriate to compensate the world’s poorest people, whose survival is threatened precisely because of the mess created by developed countries.
I cannot believe that people in developed counties, when informed about the issues, would support rescuing bankers and oppose partial compensation for poor countries and regions.
I cannot believe that they will let such an injustice occur.
If they are not expressing their outrage over the injustice of it all, it can only be because they are inadequately informed.
Africa’s Latest False Choice
DJIBOUTI – With the rise of Asian economies and their desire to play a greater role on the world stage, it has been suggested that Africa should choose between keeping its partnerships with the West and embracing new alliances with the East.
This is the same false choice that African countries were told that they had to make during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union and the West, led by the United States, competed for exclusive influence across the continent.
The idea that Africa must once again choose between two competing blocs – Chinese and the Western – has become widespread among Western strategists, think tanks, and journalists.
Reducing African options to such a crude choice conjures the specter of a new “Great Game,” with foreign powers once again carving up the continent for their benefit.
According to this narrative, Asian investors, particularly the Chinese, will gorge themselves on the continent’s resources until nothing is left.
African governments and businesses take a more nuanced view.
In recent years, Western investors have fixed their sights on emerging markets such as Brazil and China, leaving a funding gap for the pioneer markets of Africa.
Many of our Asian partners have been successful in developing their industrial base, something that African countries seek to do as well.
China, after all, is now the world’s largest economy (in terms of purchasing power parity), just three decades after opening itself to rapid development.
Meanwhile, economic growth is no longer a distant promise in Africa, but a reality.
According to the World Bank, Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP grew at a 4.7% annual rate in 2013, with the pace expected to accelerate to 5.1% in 2015 and 2016.
Today, no global investor can afford to ignore Africa’s tremendous potential.
Similarly, no developing country should ignore the great opportunities implied by engagement with Asia’s emerging powers.
It is only natural that trade and diplomatic relations between two dynamic continents should be on an upward path.
The numbers are impressive.
Exports from Africa to Asia increased more than sixfold between 2001 and 2011.
Trade between the two continents now almost matches that between Africa and Europe, and China has become Africa’s single largest trading partner, with trade flows rising from $11 billion in 2000 to $210 billion last year.
China’s direct investment in Africa has grown from a scant $500 million in 2003 to $15 billion in 2012.
And there is plenty of room for further growth.
Africa accounts for only 5% of China’s overall foreign trade and investment. This is dwarfed by China’s investment in the US, for example, where it has accumulated $1.3 trillion in US government debt alone.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has been explicit about his country’s desire to form a progressive relationship with the continent, based on mutual respect, with a commitment to develop African communities.
It is instructive that, although Africa accounts for only a small fraction of China’s foreign investment, it has received nearly half of China’s total foreign aid.
For Africa, the focus must be on building the right environment for investment.
In building ties with Asia, African governments have an opportunity to learn from the region’s economic success stories, while boosting their own countries’ industrial development.
Much of Asia’s investment in Africa has focused on infrastructure that directly supports African priorities: telecoms, power plants and transmission lines, water and sanitation, roads and railways, ports, aviation, and airports.
These investments represent a long-term commitment, and Africa benefits in many ways, gaining not only jobs today, but also a more advanced industrial base that will underpin employment and drive economic growth long into the future.
These investments also support Africa’s drive toward greater mobility, higher productivity, and a more prominent role in world trade.
And, by fostering competition for projects and mobilizing a more diverse pool of investors, they have enhanced Africa’s economic security.
Of course, short-term investment and economic growth cannot come at the expense of medium-term social development and job creation or long-term sustainability and stability.
We understand this, and so do our partners.
It is the responsibility of all African governments to ensure that investments and partnerships – whether with emerging-market investors such as China, Brazil, India, and the Gulf states, or with Europe and the US – are built on fair terms.
To see the ties between Africa and Asia as part of a battle between East and West is simplistic, outdated, and, above all, wrong-headed.
Greater interest in the continent is the result of reforms that have emboldened foreign investors – from both East and West – and of Africa’s growing ability to get the best deal for its economy and people.
Africa\u0027s \
I visited Ghana recently and like many others left asking: how can a "developing" country be developed?
But there was something troubling about this formulation, in particular with the word "developing," which is often a euphemism for theabsence of economic development.
Do countries stop developing because outsiders are so intent on developing them?
My hosts, the Kweku Hutchful Foundation, invited me with a different question in mind: How can Ghanaian leaders be developed?
Something troubled me about this formulation, too. It was that word "development" again.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Do we really "develop" leaders or countries?
Do multinational companies, international non-governmental organizations, and multilateral lenders really understand local needs?
Just because some "best practice" works in New York, does that mean it will work in Accra, Ghana?
Imagine how American managers would react to consultants arriving from Ghana with their "best practice": "It worked in Accra, so it is bound to work in New York!"
Of course, there is a prominent example of just that: Kofi Annan, under whose stewardship the UN has undergone a remarkable improvement.
Annan spent most of his career outside of Ghana, and had some of his higher education in the US.
But, as one of Annan's advisors once put it, he "runs the UN like an old-fashioned African village, with long discussions among the elders, periods of reflection, and eventually a decision."
Of course, Annan can hardly control the UN by imposing great strategies on everyone else, as American corporate CEOs do.
But perhaps he knows better.
Unlike most American CEOs, Annan was not parachuted in from outside; he is the first career employee to lead the UN.
So he knew what was wrong and appreciated that it had to be fixed carefully and patiently, by engaging the staff rather than intimidating them.
His re-election to a second term as UN Secretary General was supported by nations all over the world, rich and poor, as well as by UN employees.
Was Kofi Annan "developed?"
Perhaps we don't develop leaders so much as foster the conditions that bring out leadership.
If so, then a key condition must be the self-respect that comes from working things out for ourselves, individually and collectively.
This self-respect is fostered by organizations and institutions that can likewise stand on their own feet, building on the best of their own cultural traditions.
Passive importation of techniques, controls, and beliefs, via agencies and experts that run around solving everyone else's problems, may be the biggest impediment to development--just another form of outside exploitation, of which Africa has had more than enough.
Is it not time for indigenous development, of countries and leaders alike?
One thing is clear. Countries like Ghana do not lack enterprise.
Markets and personal initiative are pervasive.
At a red light in New York, a squeegee kid or two might approach your car; in Accra, a stopped car is immediately surrounded by a virtual supermarket.
What Ghana and most of Africa lacks is not enterprise, butenterprises.
Micro-financing--small loans to self-employed craftspeople and the like--can help.
But development at this level may not be the problem.
The problem is the lack of indigenous enterprises incorporated beyond the efforts of individuals and small families.
Instead, foreign corporations, with their funds, controls, and experts--and, just as importantly, their beliefs--dominate larger enterprise.
To be sure, foreign corporations can do good things: bring in fresh ideas, techniques, and processes, as well as capital and the scale required in some contemporary forms of manufacturing.
But nothing they do--aside from cosmetic modifications to consumer products and marketing tactics--responds to local conditions.
Development as now practiced often fails because it does not build on a country's unique strengths, respect its social traditions, or foster the autonomy necessary to develop indigenous leaders and enterprises.
All too often, it isforced development, imposed against people's natural inclinations and will.
Pride, dignity, and self-confidence do not figure in economic theory: they cannot be measured.
But they figure prominently in just about every story of success, whether of countries or of leaders.
How people feel about themselves, personally and collectively, greatly influences the energy with which they develop themselves.
America, for example, did not develop by depending on an imposed ideology or outside experts.
It developed through the indigenous efforts of Americans acting in their own way--assisted by extensive state intervention, through land grants to farmers, railroads, and mining companies, military spending that stimulated the economy (and still does), and, of course, tariff barriers.
Likewise, indigenous development played a key role in Japan and Germany after WWII, in South Korea more recently, and the UK long before.
In fact, hasany country ever developed primarily through the wholesale importation of capital, expertise, and beliefs--the equivalent of globalization today?
For the answer to how to develop an economy, we need look no further than those economies that have developed: begin with a great deal of indigenous initiative, support it with concerted state intervention, and reinforce it with the appropriate importation of external help.
Globalization must not be allowed to blind us.
Ghana certainly needs to develop economically, because material wealth is required to improve health, provide education, and sustain democracy.
But the reverse is also true: a deep-rooted sense of democracy--precisely what globalization lacks--seems necessary to support economic efforts.
The (economically) developed West should consider importing that lesson.
Africa’s Avoidable AIDS Crisis
NEW YORK – At Uganda’s largest AIDS clinic, I recently witnessed a remarkable celebration of life.
The performers were a troupe of young African singers, drummers and dancers, ranging in age from roughly eight to 28.
Rarely have I been so profoundly moved.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; “This is a land,” they sang,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; “Where beautiful people
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Laugh and dance in harmony.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Africa. O Africa.”
And, indeed, these young people laughed and danced not only in harmony but with a joie de vivre that lit up their faces and filled us all with happiness.
Listening, it was hard to imagine that they could easily be dead – and would be, if not for this clinic.
Each of those splendid performers is living with HIV.
Some arrived at the clinic so ill that they could scarcely walk.
Others showed few symptoms but, having tested positive, came to be treated.
They were mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, children and grandparents. All were alive and healthy for one reason only: the Joint Clinical Research Center in Kampala, and the drugs that it provides them.
Uganda was the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic.
There the scourge began in earnest; there (as elsewhere in Africa) it exacts its highest toll.
Yet Uganda is also a success story.
A decade ago, fewer than 10,000 people were taking the new generation of antiretroviral drugs that suppress the disease and offer the promise of a normal life.
Today, that figure is 200,000, thanks in large measure to generous support from the United States (under its PEPFAR program) and the Global Fund in Geneva.
We have seen similarly encouraging progress elsewhere.
Botswana, among others, has invested heavily to offer universal treatment, and now is well on its way to ensuring that no baby is born with HIV – a reality in developed countries, but not so in Africa, where 400,000 children are born with the disease each year.
South Africa, with the largest number of people living with HIV, has spent nearly $1 billion over the past year in an ambitious counseling and testing campaign to roll back the epidemic.
But there is a new and growing danger that these advances might not be sustained.
Peter Mugyenyi, who runs the Joint Clinical Research Center, told me that part of the problem is the sheer weight of numbers.
In Uganda, only about half of those with HIV/AIDS are being treated. Meanwhile, money for treatment is drying up.
Because of the global recession, some international donors are threatening to cap their financial support.
Countries such as Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, as well as Uganda, are requesting assistance for emergency drug supplies.
In Kampala, Dr. Mugyenyi has begun placing new patients on a waiting list.
As many as seven million Africans who should be getting treatment for HIV are not. Worldwide, the number is about 10 million.
Compounding the problem: donors have also been shifting their focus from AIDS to other diseases, because there is a sense that more lives can be saved more cheaply.
At a time when we should be scaling up to meet the AIDS challenge, we are dialing back.
In our global war on AIDS, the international community is on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
Those who rallied to the fight are alarmed.
They fear that the impressive gains of the last decade will be lost. “We are sitting on a time bomb,” Dr. Mugyenyi told me.
Every day, he is forced into moral choices that no one should have to make.
How do you choose to treat a young girl but not her little brother?
How do you turn away a pregnant mother, sitting with her children, crying for help?
Surely we can do better.
In Kampala, I promised my young friends that I would do everything I could to help.
In Washington recently, the United Nations rolled out an action plan that should dramatically accelerate progress on maternal and child health, including HIV.
At the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, in July, I hope that the international community will rally around UNAIDS’ launch of Treatment 2.0 — the next generation of HIV treatment, which must be more affordable, more effective, and accessible to all.
As chair of this year’s replenishment of the Global Fund, I urge all donors to see to it that countries such as Uganda get the support they need, so that Dr. Mugyenyi and other front-line soldiers in the fight against AIDS need not make those difficult choices.
I left Uganda with a snatch of song that still echoes within my heart.
Its inherent truth would be obvious, had you been there to see:&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We are still useful.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To our countries, to our families.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All we need is a way to live our days,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All we need is to survive in Africa.
Yes, times are hard.
That is all the more reason to act out of compassion and with generosity.
Africa\u0027s Debt Dilemma
The success that US President George W. Bush and his special envoy, former Secretary of State James Baker, had in getting Iraq's foreign debts canceled or rescheduled shows what can be done when a policy is backed by political will.
The contrast with Africa's debts could hardly be starker.
Just three years ago,Jubilee 2000made news when civil society groups, rock stars, and a few finance ministers like Britain's Gordon Brown pushed for African debt cancellation.
President Bush mostly succeeded in his crusade;Jubilee 2000succeeded mostly in getting empty promises.
Of course, the two campaigns confronted different obstacles and had different bases of support.
Baker's mission possessed the unlimited backing of a US faced with the gargantuan cost of reconstructing Iraq;Jubilee 2000 had only world opinion behind it.
Lucrative reconstruction contracts in Iraq gave America leverage to coerce its allies into submission;Jubilee 2000 had no such weapon of persuasion.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Finally, Baker was appealing to America's traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East, who need American friendship in many areas.
The campaign to forgive Africa's debt was, on the other hand, focused on the crushing debt load owed by African countries to the IMF and the World Bank, who only have money to worry about.
Still, the Jubilee campaign's street protests began a healthy debate about the lending arrangements of the IMF/World Bank.
But the time has come to abandon the Jubilee movement's humanitarian approach and focus instead on the legal aspect.
It is worth remembering that no sub-Saharan African country - with the exceptions of South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), then administered by white minority governments - could tap international capital markets at independence in the early 1960's.
Domestic capital markets were non-existent.
As a result, these countries were left with no choice but to subcontract their development to the IMF and World Bank.
These institutions identified, appraised, approved, and financed projects that ratcheted up African debt.
They monitored and sanctioned the recruitment of consultants that conducted the studies related to these projects, as well as the expatriate staff involved in their execution.
During the period of implementation, they carried out regular supervisory missions supplemented by quarterly progress reports and annual audits.
Still, despite all these costly measures paid for by Africans, all the post-evaluation reports on completed projects indicated that the overwhelming majority of projects were unable to generate the revenues needed to service the debts that financed them.
But the debtor countries are nonetheless obliged to service these debts by whatever means necessary, including more borrowing and further entanglement, leading to further impoverishment.
For example, per capita growth between 1965 and 1998was -0.8 in Ivory Coast and Ghana, -0.1 in Guinea Bissau, -2 in Zambia and Mauritania, and zero in Nigeria.
What went wrong?
The multilateral lenders advocated a development strategy based on the theory of comparative advantage and unbridled economic liberalization.
Africa had to open its markets while producing raw materials and basic products to generate revenues for investment in industry, education, health, and food production.
These assumptions turned out to be wrong, as export prices fell steadily over four decades.
But it should have been obvious from the outset that the IMF/World Bank strategy was doomed to fail.
All developed nations protected and subsidized their domestic production in the first phases of their development - and still do whenever it suits them.
Furthermore the US, the EU member states and the East Asian countries all regulated inward foreign investment and imposed capital controls.
Partnerships with foreign companies were designed to allow local businesses to benefit from technology transfer and training, while creating the most favorable conditions for local producers to add value to domestic production and exports.
In the face of these undeniable facts, the path chosen by the IMF and the World Bank was, at best, a mark of their incompetence and, at worst, a deliberate ploy to keep the sub-Saharan countries and their populations in bondage.
Whatever the case, both institutions certainly have much to answer for - and the loan agreements provide an arbitration clause to bring them to account.
These clauses have yet to be invoked, but for the sake of unity and to strengthen the solidarity of African countries, it would be advisable for the nascent African Union take the lead.
The AU should seek legal advice, have the issue included on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, advocate the freezing of international debt payments while arbitration proceedings are taking place and secure the support of the international community, especially NGOs that have a track record in raising awareness about Africa's debts.
Any compensation retrieved from such legal proceedings should be used to establish an African monetary fund whose objective would be to put Africa on a fast track to comprehensive regional integration, enabling the continent to capitalize on globalization's positive features.
Litigation can be costly and hazardous.
However, set against the alternative of relying on handouts punctuated by desperation and frequent episodes of collective self-destruction, Africa should choose the legal option to rally its people and rescue its development process.
Africa’s Diaspora to the Rescue
DAKAR – There is something dismally familiar about the tide of news reports concerning Africa’s increased suffering – more poverty, malnutrition, civil strife, and death – in the face of the recent global financial crisis.
Almost everywhere, the media translates academic conclusions into graphic illustrations of brutality and despair in places such as Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But there is another, woefully under-reported, side to the story.
African countries that were locked out of international capital markets for most of the past five decades have largely been spared the twin woes of financial turmoil and economic downturn.
The continent’s economies experienced a slowdown, but not a recession.
Indeed, according to McKinsey &amp; Company, Africa was the third-largest contributor to world economic growth in 2009, after China and India.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Moreover, several African countries have received ratings from credit agencies, which has opened up global financial centers to them.
In some cases, these ratings have proved equivalent to or higher than those of countries such as Turkey or Argentina.
Stock exchanges are being established across the continent.
Furthermore, countries such as China, India, and Brazil has provided a platform for increased exports and the inception of a model of cooperation based on trade, investment, and technology transfer, rather than “aid.”
China-Africa trade alone increased from $10 billion in 2000 to $107 billion in 2008, and billions of dollars are being invested in oil production, mining, transportation, electricity generation and transmission, telecommunications, and other infrastructure.
These developments have combined to improve African countries’ macroeconomic performance dramatically.
Inflation has been halved since the 1990’s, and foreign-exchange reserves have increased 30%.
Public finances showed a 2.8%-of-GDP surplus in 2008, compared to a 1.4%-of-GDP deficit in 2000-2005.
Savings rates are between 10% and 20%, and external debt has decreased from 110% of GDP in 2005 to 21% in 2008.
Since 2000, sub-Saharan African countries have achieved economic growth of 5-7%.
Many factors have contributed to this upturn.
Emerging-market demand has pushed up commodity prices.
Urbanization has given rise to a dynamic informal sector.
Improved governance, higher food production, increased inter-regional trade, debt cancellation, better use of official development assistance (ODA), and thriving telecommunications and housing markets have helped as well.
But transfers from the African diaspora stand out as the most significant contributing factor.
A study commissioned by the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development indicates that more than 30 million individuals living outside their countries of origin contribute more than $40 billion annually in remittances to their families and communities back home.
For sub-Saharan African countries, remittances increased from $3.1 billion in 1995 to $18.5 billion in 2007, according to the World Bank, representing between 9% and 24% of GDP and 80-750% of ODA.
Migrants’ remittance behavior is essentially dictated by the regulatory environment and the quality – in terms of speed, cost, security, and accessibility – of products and services offered by banks, money-transfer companies, micro-finance institutions, and informal operators.
In this respect, there are three different strategies in place in Africa.
The Anglophone strategy focuses on freeing up the remittance market by encouraging competition, relaxing regulatory constraints for non-bank operators, offering financial incentives, encouraging technical and financial innovation, and stimulating collaboration among market players.
This approach, also adopted by Italy, contributes to reducing costs and increasing the overall volume of funds for beneficiaries.
The Hispanic approach emphasizes migrants’ involvement in banking by offering a range of banking services in both the country of origin and the host country, products of specific interest to migrants, and low commissions on foreign transfers.
This approach, widely developed by Morocco and the Portuguese-speaking world, is epitomized by the zero-commission policy initiated by the Spanish bank Santander and its Moroccan counterpart, Attijariwafa Bank.
Finally, the Francophone approach relies on two types of monopoly.
The first is enjoyed by Western Union, which controls up to 90% of the total formal transfer volume within Africa’s 16-member Franc Zone.
Western Union charges fees as high as 25% on transfers to these countries, compared to an average global benchmark of 5%, and has required that Franc-Zone countries sign exclusivity agreements, thereby preventing foreign-exchange bureaux, post offices, and micro-finance institutions from carrying out money transfers.
The second monopoly is exercised in the banking sector.
France has a veto within the boards of directors of the Franc Zone’s two central banks, while two French commercial banks, BNP-Paribas and Société Générale, exercise a quasi-monopoly on lending programs, mainly centered on short-term trade financing and the needs of governments, public and private companies, and the elite.
All other local banks have adopted the same approach, severely restricting access to financial services for households and entrepreneurs.
Despite the increasing importance of remittances from Italy, Spain, and the United States, the largest share in absolute terms still originates from France.
There is thus a real need in the Franc Zone for a financing institution that would convert migrant remittances into productive investments, thereby generating jobs and wealth, and that would broaden access to banking services, mortgages, insurance products, pension plans, and technical assistance.
Official statistics for 2009 are likely to show that migrants’ remittances fell sharply, as the global recession severely eroded job opportunities abroad.
That makes it all the more important that African countries, many of which have laid a strong groundwork for sustainable growth, have a financial system in place that can leverage remittances effectively as the global economy recovers.
Africa’s Dictator-Diplomat
BRUSSELS – The recent death in Brussels of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi finally brings to light what lay behind his mysterious two-month disappearance from public life.
Ethiopia’s government had strenuously denied rumors of serious ill health caused by liver cancer.
Now that the worst has, indeed, proven true, Ethiopia and all of East Africa will need to learn to live without the stabilizing influence of its great dictator-diplomat.
Meles was certainly both.
Ethiopia has undergone a remarkable transformation under his strongman rule since 1991, when his Tigrayan minority group from the country’s north came to power with the overthrow of the odious Communist Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam (still enjoying a comfortable retirement in Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe).
Initially serving as the president of the first post-Derg government, and then as Ethiopia’s prime minister from 1995 until his death, Meles (his nom de guerre in the revolution) oversaw 7.7% annual GDP growth in recent years.
Strong economic performance is somewhat surprising, given his party’s interventionist policy approach, but Meles showed himself to be a consummate pragmatist in attracting investment – particularly from China – to drive growth.
Meles’s own political provenance as the leader of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front was Marxist-Leninist.
But, when the Cold War ended, so, too, did his dogmatism.
To his credit, child mortality was reduced by 40% under his government; Ethiopia’s economy became more diversified, with new industries like car manufacturing, beverages, and floriculture; and major infrastructure projects, including Africa’s largest hydroelectric dam, were launched.
Once a basket-case associated in the world’s eyes only with famine and drought, Ethiopia has become one of Africa’s largest economies – and without the benefit of gold or oil.
Perhaps more important than Meles’s domestic achievements was his diplomatic record.
He was an indispensable ally of the West in the fight against Islamist terrorism, culminating in Ethiopia’s military operation in neighboring Somalia in 2006.
More recently, Meles coordinated efforts with Kenya to stage limited strikes against the al-Shabaab militia, which has waged an unrelenting war to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy.
At the same time, Meles courted China as both an investor and as a hedge against the West’s criticism of his human-rights record.
And yet he controversially but rightly held out a hand of friendship to the breakaway region of Somaliland, before it became fashionable, and went as far as he could short of formal re-recognition of that ray of democratic hope in the Horn of Africa.
Meles will be sorely missed in Hargeisa, as he planned to run a Chinese-financed gas pipeline through Somaliland territory from the Ogaden to the coast.
More important, Meles put Addis Ababa on the map as the home of the African Union, and as a capital where Africa’s worst problems could be discussed in a pragmatic manner, unburdened by colonial grudges.
Meles himself became a major diplomatic player, particularly over climate-change policy, and most recently was active in mediating border and natural-resource disputes between Sudan and the newly independent (and oil-rich) South Sudan.
He will be remembered for accepting the painful secession of Eritrea in 1993, rather than prolong the civil war, and for his efforts to reach an agreement with Egypt over the use of the Blue Nile waters.
The great stain on Meles’s record will always be his intolerance of dissent.
To be sure, his human-rights record was far better than the Derg’s.
For example, he allowed a private press to flourish, and in 2000 he became the first Ethiopian leader to hold multi-party parliamentary elections.
Moreover, compared to neighboring Eritrea under President Isaias Afewerki or Omar al-Bashir’s Sudan, his regime was by no means the worst offender in the region.
Nor was there much evidence of personal enrichment or widespread corruption.
Nevertheless, following a violently contested parliamentary election in 2005, in which more than 30 parties participated, Meles demonstrated open contempt for democratic pluralism and press freedom, jailing several journalists in recent years.
At the same time, he imposed increasingly strict central control on his ethnically and linguistically diverse country.
Although nominally governed by “ethnic federalism,” where this threatened secession, as in Oromia or the Ogaden, Meles was quick to ignore the constitutional set-up.
Although he strengthened religious freedom and peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians, the human-rights situation in Ethiopia remained poor.
For example, groups like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented widespread official repression of the Oromo people.
And yet Meles is irreplaceable – unmatched intellectually as an African leader (he dropped out of medical school, but went on to teach himself impeccable English and obtain European university degrees by correspondence), and unmatched politically at home, with no obvious successor groomed to replace him.
In the Horn of Africa, there is no leader of his stature who could ensure the stability and strong governance that the region so desperately needs.
Hailemariam Desalegn, Meles’s foreign minister, will take over Ethiopia’s government.
But there will be considerable concern in the West about the danger of a power vacuum or struggle in a geopolitically vital but fractious country –&nbsp;and just when neighboring Somalia is supposed to be undergoing a transition to a new parliament and elected government.
For his admirers and critics alike, Meles leaves behind a potent political legacy.
He will be remembered as an African leader of major historical significance: visionary, despotic, and indispensable.
Africa’s Economic House Divided
DAKAR – The world economic downturn and financial-market tremors have strained budgets across Africa.
With the exception of Ghana, and a few other states, in 2009 most African countries’ fiscal balances deteriorated.
But, thanks to prudent management of public finances during previous periods of robust growth, a significant number of African countries have endured the current crisis in better fiscal shape than during past crises.
In 2009, aggregate GDP growth in Africa averaged 1.6%, down from about 5.7% during the 2002-2008 period – but growth all the same.
Moreover, several African countries continued to implement long-term reforms to improve their business and investment climate, despite the daunting challenges presented by the crisis.
Now that international trade and global industrial production are on the mend, sub-Saharan economies look set for more robust growth, as demand for and prices of oil and other minerals rebound and general economic activity resumes.
Of course, numerous downside risks – adverse weather shocks, military conflict, and political turmoil – still can undermine the hard-earned benefits of this social and economic record.
But it is the dichotomized nature of their economies and finances that represents Africa’s most intractable structural imbalance.
Frankly, two Africa’s are emerging: a modern economy and a cash-based economy.
Across Africa, almost all governments praise – some honestly, some not – economic modernization as the cornerstone of prosperity and the yardstick by which their effectiveness should be measured. Many boast of the modernity of the financial infrastructure of their economies, which is based on an entire set of legal, regulatory, accounting, credit reporting, and payment and settlement systems.
National payment systems operate electronic-based payment products and services.
A high-value inter-bank funds-transfer system settles transactions in real time, eliminates credit risk between system participants, increases circulation of funds, and enhances monetary-policy implementation.
Banks are provided with a facility to monitor their positions in real time and hence make cost-effective investment decisions.
So far, only a few registered financial institutions, primarily offshoots of Western commercial banks, have access to such payment-system facilities.
Non-banking financial institutions such as foreign exchange bureaus, post offices, and micro-finance lenders are not admitted, even when they are financially sound and sustainable.
The effects of banks’ hijacking of national payment systems to service only the modern economy are compounded by the exclusive agreements that banks and money-transfer companies such as Western Union have signed with most African countries.
These agreements lock out non-banking entities from the highly lucrative market for migrant remittances from the African diaspora, which remain a key engine of growth.
Yet rapid urbanization everywhere in Africa has given rise to a dynamic informal sector unconnected to the modern economy.
Although marginalized by African officials, this cash-based economy is a major contributor to the continent’s productive capacity.
It employs more than 90% of the workforce and is home to 75% of the retailers.
But, despite the pivotal economic role that the informal sector plays, it has no access to conventional bank loans.
Micro-finance institutions provide the only credit lines open to informal operators.
The micro-finance business model is based on lending that is guaranteed by the group.
This translates into a solidarity network and a support mechanism that mitigates credit risk and encourages payment discipline. Credit repayment in well-managed micro-finance institutions is around 95%. All studies undertaken in the area have also revealed that women are not only the most active among informal-sector entrepreneurs, but they are also quicker to meet their commitments.
African states must now recognize that modernizing their informal sectors by integrating them into the modern economy can be a major development tool. Yet only a few countries have started moving in that direction.
Nigeria has refrained from signing any exclusive agreements with Western Union and others, and its newly consolidated banking industry is making significant inroads across the region.
Rwanda, too, has enacted regulations that eliminate exclusive agreements, opening doors for micro-finance institutions to become payment-service providers.
The South African Reserve Bank has created a special platform within its national payment system for micro-finance institutions and non-banks.
Malawi’s national payments system is directly accessible to non-bank participants, including third-party service providers.
Giving micro-finance institutions access to national and regional payments systems and electronic retail facilities will go a long way toward meeting the requirements of the retail and business sector in terms of banking facilities.
It will also help facilitate access by the poorest to financial services, thus helping to reduce the high proportion of the un-banked population.
All of this will invariably spur development and integration of national financial systems and intra-regional trade.
This will be a welcome development, because a large proportion of intra-regional trade is carried out by informal operators and small and medium enterprises that do not have access to the banking system.
Moreover, economic integration and increased intra-regional trade are the best entry point into global markets for all countries.
When it comes to analyzing what ails Africa, it is customary to dwell at length on the continent’s traumatic past.
But it strains the imagination to link Africa’s colonial-era pains with the willingness of African leaders to spend a fortune to equip their countries with state-of-the-art settlement systems, and then proceed to exclude their citizens from using them.
Abraham Lincoln once said that a house divided cannot stand. There is an economic corollary to this: an economic house divided cannot prosper.
Africa’s Hard Black Gold
LAGOS - Few infrastructure services in the developed world may be as taken for granted as electric power.
To consumers in industrialized countries, uninterrupted power supply is a given.
Not so in much of Africa, which experiences some of the world’s greatest power deficits, and where only two in ten people have access to electricity.
According to the International Monetary Fund’s most recentRegional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, in 2007 alone, nearly two-thirds of the countries in the region experienced an acute energy crisis marked by frequent and extended electricity outages.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });There is no shortage of hydropower plants for electricity generation in Africa.
However, many of these plants are unable to keep up with rapid population growth and attendant increases in demand.
Furthermore, they are prone to frequent drought, which reduces their output significantly, leaving many as little more than decorative infrastructure landmarks.
Increasingly burgeoning populations in countries like Nigeria and Ghana imply a greater extraction of water resources for power generation.
Rapid expansion of agricultural activity is requiring more and more water all across the continent.
Other resources like fuel oil, diesel, light crude, solar, and gas are also available as means of electricity generation, but their costs are all quite prohibitive.
These factors make a good argument for coal as a cheap alternative source of Africa's power.
Coal has historically played a crucial role as a source of energy worldwide, and has several important advantages over other fossil fuels.  First is its relative abundance.
The current level of proven coal reserves worldwide stands at roughly 850 billion tons.
Africa has about 50 billion tons.
Coal is also much more widely distributed geographically than any other fossil fuel.
Worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50% since 1980, and is expected to grow annually by 1.6% between now and 2030.
More than 70% of this new demand will come from developing countries, with fossil fuels projected to account for about 80% of total energy demand by the end of this period.
Coal is the world’s fastest growing fossil fuel, with annual production increasing by 6.4% since 2004.
It is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-consuming nations.
Much of the future increases in coal-fired electricity generation will come from strategically important developing countries like China and India.
In 2006 alone, China added about 93,000 megawatts of coal- fired electricity generating capacity, and this trend is expected to continue as the country tries to meet its huge energy needs.
Even in many developed countries, coal still accounts for a large share of power generation.
Coal plants currently provide more than half of America’s electricity supply.
Denmark, which houses some of the most efficient coal-fired power plants in the world, equally relies on coal for half of its electricity production.
The same is true for Germany, which is home to some of the most efficient pulverized coal combustion units in Europe.
Poland uses coal for 98% of its electricity production, and South Africa uses coal for about 50% of its electricity production.
Against this picture then, it is hard not to expect developing countries to exploit their abundant coal resources to generate power for their own development, especially given that modern technology can help produce coal cleanly.
Some argue that gas might be a better alternative to hydro or coal, but for countries that must import much of their gas the benefits of a stable and reliable source of cheap fuel in the form of coal present a very strong counter-argument to the capital costs of a gas plant.
Unlike prices for coal, which is abundant and dispersed geographically, gas prices are subject to significant volatility, and the long-term trend in the face of fossil fuel depletion is uncertain.
In contrast, coal prices are more stable, and may remain that way for a long time.
Apart from electric-power generation, coal also has wide application in a number of industries.
It is pivotal in both steel and cement production.
Moreover, the use of wood by Africa’s growing population is causing increasingly rapid deforestation in many countries.
There is significant potential domestic demand for coal briquettes to replace wood for cooking and domestic and industrial heating.
The demand outlook thus appears favorable for the coal industry, creating significant investment opportunities.
Clearly, there are environmental drawbacks from the use of coal as an energy resource, and these concerns are far too important to overlook.
The massive reserves notwithstanding, coal is still a finite resource.
It must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitigating the environmental impact.
Fortunately, much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-products of coal use.
With acid rain and other public-health hazards linked to coal combustion, more technologies are emerging for reducing harmful emissions from power plants.
Fueled by research, the past few years have witnessed the development of increasingly cleaner and more energy-efficient coal-fired generation plants and the retirement of older technologies, especially in the developed world.
Developing countries have lagged behind in this process, but, with the common threat of global warming, there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies.
Africa's mineral-rich countries must exploit their abundant natural resources.
They must use coal to advance their economic development.
Failure to do so would be a missed opportunity at a time when African countries must avail themselves of all available resources for poverty reduction.
Africa’s Integration Imperative
Karl Marx predicted that states would wither away in anticipation of an idyllic communist society capable of auto-regulating economic imbalances and empowering the masses.
So he would have been flabbergasted to see his prophecy realized, not by communism, but by the globalization of Anglo-American economic liberalism.
Opening up markets to the free flow of capital, not the dictatorship of the proletariat, has rendered state power obsolete.
Today’s capital markets raise money for governments, corporate clients, and individual customers, manage pension funds’ investments, and bet on the level of interest rates or the stock market.
Trading in derivatives by investment banks, hedge funds, and other market participants, reaps huge profits for traders while depriving the real economy of productive investment and job creation.
No population in the world is spared from the harsh treatment of such a system.
Some 40% of the world’s 6.5 billion people live in poverty, and a sixth live in extreme poverty.
However, the world’s black populations are the prime victims.
In the United States, one-eighth of all black males between the ages of 25 and 34 are in jail, and three out of five black American households with children are headed by a single mother.
As for African countries, the politics and economics of globalization have stripped them of their assets and natural resources and left them with an unbearable debt burden.
As a result, the percentage of Africa’s population living in extreme poverty increased from 41.6% in 1981 to 46.9% in 2001.
On the other hand, in the era of globalization, regions in which internal trade exceeds external trade have better economic outlooks and stronger social cohesion.
This is the case for Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, particularly among the member states of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay).
The opposite is true for regional groupings in Africa and in the Middle East where trade with the outside world is more important than intra-regional trade.
As a result, any country formulating strategies to counter the destructive forces of globalization should give overriding priority to a self-centred economic development strategy, preferably within a regional framework.
This is a prerequisite to defending against market fundamentalism and avoiding the iniquitous conditions of the international marketplace.
In this respect, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) constitutes an edifying example.
The ASEAN economies adopted a united front on international economic issues and accorded priority to internal economic integration and expanding linkages with major trading partners.
Exports have remained the main driver of economic performance for the ASEAN countries, contributing to 5.8% regional GDP growth in 2006.
ASEAN foreign direct investment (FDI) flows reached US$38 billion in 2005, up by 48% from the previous year.
The outlook for 2006 was also bullish, with preliminary data for the first quarter indicating that FDI flows had already reached US$14 billion, up from US$7.4 billion in the year-earlier period.
ASEAN’s drive to establish a fully-fledged economic community has been underlined by implementation of its Priority Integration Sector Roadmaps.
By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa’s historical legacy of artificial and unmanageable colonial boundaries, ethnic antagonisms, its citizens’ deficit of self-respect, and an appalling record of leadership failures has hampered its quest for economic integration.
But a sector-by-sector approach could mitigate these handicaps, and, given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change, it might be strategically advisable to start with the energy sector.   
Africa is a continent rich in energy, holding two-thirds of the world’s reserves of hydro-electric power – trillions of kilowatt-hours representing about half of total world resources.
The Congo River alone holds more than 600 billion kilowatt-hours of annual reserves. The Sanaga (Cameroon) and the Ogooué (Gabon) hold half as much.
Technological breakthroughs have made it feasible to transport electricity via high-voltage direct current (HVDC) over long distances without incurring great losses (only about 3% per 1,000 kilometers).
Carbon-free hydroelectric power is the right choice as sub-Saharan Africa’s principal source of energy.
Harnessing the hydroelectric power of the Congo Basin alone would be enough to meet all of Africa’s energy needs, or to light the entire continent of South America. Moreover, establishing an African grid would enable power from the Democratic Republic of Congo to be delivered to southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.
However, while 90% of world reserves of hydraulic energy are concentrated in underdeveloped regions like sub-Saharan Africa, HVDC technology remains the preserve of developed countries.
There is thus an imperative not only for regional integration in Africa, but also for a joint strategic vision and partnership to help build global energy and climate security.
Africa’s Last Famine
WASHINGTON, DC – Last year, the international community recognized one of the worst humanitarian tragedies of recent times unfolding in the Horn of Africa, and moved in to ameliorate the widespread famine there.
Now, poor rains, crop shortages, and continuing conflict could cause millions to be plunged back into life-threatening levels of hunger and malnutrition.
Emergency assistance is crucial in this fragile time; but it is not enough.
Only if the agricultural sector’s fundamental inadequacies are addressed can the region truly escape famine’s blight.
Africa is endowed with 60% of the world’s unused arable land and millions of dedicated farmers.
They simply need the tools, infrastructure, and competence to unlock the continent’s tremendous agricultural potential.
There is no reason – and no excuse – to leave the survival of millions to unpredictable weather conditions.
Rather, countries must take control by drastically improving efficiency and productivity.
To be sure, progress has been made.
Some African governments have reduced regulatory barriers to private-sector investment in agriculture.
And some are implementing risk-management and hedging tools to shield farmers from drought and flood, and poor consumers from the food-price volatility that such disasters cause.
For example, the Global Index Insurance Facility insures Kenyan farmers against drought or excessive rainfall.
Such initiatives foster the flow of resources into agriculture – both for the agribusinesses needed to feed Africa’s growing cities, and for smallholders who need better seeds, fertilizer, and market roads.
Although more developed regions have been taking such measures, they are not yet standard practice in Africa.
The continent’s agricultural sector is further hindered by low skills, a dearth of innovation, weak infrastructure, little funding, and lack of access to land, land titles, and lender security.
But, given the right tools, all of these problems are solvable.
For example, in order to finance reform, local banks need incentives to expand credit.
That could mean access to specialized credit bureaus and rating agencies, risk-sharing facilities targeting smallholders, and advisory services to provide capacity-building and education.
These banks also need direct support.
For example, the International Finance Corporation is investing $25 million in Zambia National Commercial Bank to increase access to finance for small-scale entrepreneurs and rural agribusiness companies, which account for a significant share of Zambia’s economic output.
Moreover, innovative financing techniques – such as structured trade finance, warehouse receipt finance, and supplier finance – are already in place or being developed.
Under the Global Warehouse Receipt Program, for example, farmers may use produce stored in depositories as collateral for loans.
Smallholder farm-mechanization models are also needed to improve efficiency and increase yields.
Farmers could be grouped together to pool their production and negotiate a favorable offtake agreement to monetize future sales, then use the receipts to lease equipment, such as tractors.
Water is another major constraint on food production in some regions.
Most affected countries are working to increase supply by developing new sources of ground and surface water, using wastewater from nearby urban areas, harvesting rainwater, or reusing agricultural drainage.
Meanwhile, some countries are focusing on reducing demand, through improved management and innovative agricultural techniques, such as precision and drip irrigation.
Africa also needs better infrastructure in order to boost food output.
Limited access to electricity means that cold storage is lacking; poorly maintained roads slow down old vehicles; and inefficient ports often leave food to rot on the docks.
Production is meaningless if fresh products do not make it to market in good condition and at a reasonable cost.
Finally, Africa’s transformation into an agricultural powerhouse must be based on inclusiveness and environmental sustainability.
Investments should ensure an equitable division of benefits between producers and consumers, and include smallholder participation and linkages to markets for inputs and outputs.
And investors must account for the interests of host countries, local communities, and the environment – an approach that is both good and good business.
Long-term food security in Africa is possible.
In fact, it is only the first step on the road to a booming agricultural export sector for Africa.
By acting now, African and international leaders can ensure not only the continent’s food security, but also a prosperous, inclusive economy.
Africa’s Misplaced Monetary Ambitions
DAKAR – Sub-Saharan African is in the grip of currency-union mania.
Regional groups of countries in eastern, southern, and western Africa are all giving priority to the idea of creating a monetary union.
But haven’t we heard this all before in Africa?
Indeed, today’s enthusiasm for currency unions ignores the poor track record of previous attempts on the continent to establish them through peaceful means.
A common currency requires unified and centrally agreed monetary and fiscal policies. But this necessitates political integration, which, as the troubles of the euro this year have demonstrated, is a hard sell among nation-states.
Before the euro’s arrival on the international financial scene in 1999, the only examples of countries with common currencies were neo-colonial francophone Africa and nineteenth-century precedents like the Latin American and Scandinavian monetary unions.
The creation of the CFA franc, which gives France control of 65% of the CFA countries’ foreign-exchange reserves, combined currency convertibility with a grossly overvalued parity – pegged first to the French franc and now to the euro – as well as trade barriers.
This led only to structural deficits, vast capital flight, and, in 1994, a 100% devaluation.
Yet, despite the difficulties that have bedeviled the CFA (and the euro of late) – indeed, despite the absence of viable regional customs unions (except in the East African Community), let alone a single market – Africans retain a strong allegiance to the idea of a currency union.
That allegiance is misplaced.
At this stage of their economic development, with its focus on commodity exports, the priority for Africa’s countries should be long-term economic integration, not currency union.
Here, the model to follow is not the euro, but Latin America’s Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Both regional groupings have, by lowering trade barriers, delivered a real catalyst to economic growth.
Mercosur’s member countries have adopted a strategy that prioritizes the creation of a free-trade area.
They steered clear of establishing a heavy budget-fueled bureaucracy, leaving respective ministries to handle administering the accord. In 2008, Mercosur intra-regional exports reached $41.6 billion, up by 28.4% from 2007.
The external trade of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil within the area amounted, respectively, to 65%, 33%, and 15% of their total exports.
The other major advantage of such regional groupings has been their ability to attract foreign direct investment. Since the early 1990’s, Mercosur has managed to mobilize 5.9% of world FDI inflows.
In 2008, it attracted a record $56 billion in FDI, an increase of 31.5 % from 2007. Moreover, cross-investment between Mercosur member countries has led to greater economic integration. Argentina is now Brazil’s second-largest trading partner, behind the United States, while Brazil is Argentina’s largest trading partner, ahead of the US.
The seven member countries of ASEAN decided to implement economic “roadmaps” defining integration priorities, a testimony to their determination to achieve a single economic community.
A currency union, however, is not high on the agenda.
In 2009, ASEAN regional trade represented 24.6% of its members’ total exports and 24.3% of total imports.
By contrast, trade among African countries accounts for only about 10-12% of the continent’s exports and imports.
But, partly because several African countries have escaped the hang-over from the global credit crisis, more investors are focusing on business opportunities there.
By 2050, the combined GDP of the largest 11 African economies should reach more than $13 trillion, surpassing Brazil and Russia (but not China or India).
For some analysts, the emergence of countries like Brazil as economic powerhouses stems partly from successful demutualization of their stock exchanges.
Twenty-three bourses are currently operating in Africa, and their combined market capitalization has soared from $245 billion in 2002 to $1 trillion (2% of the world total) at the end of 2009 – as high as the fifteenth-largest stock exchange in the world.
With a volume of $800 billion, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange alone accounts for 80% of the total and ranks 19th worldwide.
Nigeria plans to demutualize its stock exchange in order to establish it among the prime destinations for frontier investors.
Africa stands to benefit from a massive economic turnaround, provided that the right environment for sustainable growth and rising productivity is created.
This requires consistent macroeconomic policies focused on economic integration, food self-sufficiency, low inflation, and reduced debt.
It also requires political stability, eradication of corruption, enhanced rule of law, improvement of basic levels of education, and greater use of mobile telephones and the Internet.
What it does not require is a currency union.
When it comes to exchange rates, the members of Africa’s economic groupings would be better off linking their currencies in regional monetary systems to prevent large fluctuations relative to one another.
Africa\u0027s Oil Rush
It takes a threat to oil supplies to get world leaders to pay attention to Africa.
Usually neglected by globetrotting statesmen, the continent recently saw visits from US President George W. Bush, Chinese President Hu Jintao, Brazil's Lula Da Silva, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and many other world leaders.
Their public comments were typically devoted to development, ending Africa's many wars, and the fight against HIV/AIDS, but all of them had oil on their minds.
An oil rush is underway in the continent, because all developed countries' national security depends on a steady oil supply, and sub-Saharan Africa owns 8% of the world's known reserves.
In 2002 production was 2.1 million barrels a day in Nigeria, 900,000 in Angola, 283,000 in Congo Brazzaville, 265,000 in Equatorial Guinea, 247,000 in Gabon, 227,000 in Sudan, 75,000 in Cameroon, 28,000 in South Africa, 25,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and 11,000 in Ivory Coast.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The US alone imports 1.5 million barrels a day from West Africa, the same amount it imports from Saudi Arabia.
According to the US Energy Department, within this decade American oil imports from Africa will reach 770 millions barrels annually, as exploration intensifies throughout the Gulf of Guinea, and as the US brokers peace in war-ravaged oil-producing countries, such as Sudan and Angola, and establishes strategic bases to safeguard output.
As a result, West African oil producers will be earning an estimated $200 billion over the next decade, more than 10 times the sum Western countries allocate each year to the "aid industry" in the region.
So why aren't Africans celebrating?
Because they are well aware of the "curse of oil" - corruption, conflict, ecological disaster, and anaesthetized entrepreneurial spirit.
In Nigeria, an estimated $300 billion in oil revenues entered the government's coffers over the past 25 years, but per capita income remains less than one dollar a day for the simple reason that much of the money ends up in Swiss bank accounts, like the one owned by the late dictator Sani Abacha.
In Angola, British Petroleum revealed that it had to pay a $111 million "signature bonus" to the government.
As scandalous as it might be, these sums are mere peanuts compared to the $4.5 billions in oil revenues supposedly siphoned away from African government coffers over the last decade.
But graft and theft are not the only problems.
The celebrated pipeline between Chad and Cameroon caused water pollution, devastated pygmies' hunting grounds, destroyed harvests, and spread AIDS - perhaps the inevitable result of ill-educated migrant workers toiling thousands of miles from home, with a horde of prostitutes following them.
Projected annual revenues from this project for oil companies such as Chevron, Exxon, and Petronas, and lenders like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, are estimated at $4.7 billion.
Chad will see a mere $62 million, and Cameroon just $18.6 million.
So petrodollars exacerbate poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, not cure it.
Only openness and accountability can reverse this trend.
This was the objective set by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which requested that the publication of multinational oil companies' payments to governments be made mandatory.
Unfortunately, because the companies and African politicians have every reason to avoid transparency, the EITI plans were rendered meaningless when they were not made compulsory.
What lessons can be learned from this sorry state of affairs?
One relates to the defenders of those suffering such obvious exploitation.
The people who rebelled against these injustices were not Africans, but well-wishers from western organizations such as EITI, the US aid agency Catholic Relief Services (CRS), and Global Witness.
African intellectuals, artists, and civil rights activists did not feel the need to express solidarity with fellow Africans and to defend the rights of the downtrodden.
African civil society seems trapped in indifference and inertia.
Another lesson concerns Africa's failed political leadership.
It is customary to link Africa's failures to slavery and colonization, and no one can deny such claims.
But this recognition does not exonerate Africa's "kinglets," who handed their subjects over to the slave traders.
Recently, a congregation of African church leaders convened in the Senegalese island of Gorée and urged their people to assess their share of responsibility for the slave trade.
The call went unheeded.
That is a shame, for here was a moment to expose the flaws of most African leaders throughout our tormented history.
The constant ability of Africa's leaders to betray their people is the root cause of Africa's current misery.
Their fecklessness and recklessness are what convince much of the world that Africans can do nothing but dance, slaughter each other, and beg.
Easy access to oil wealth only allows their cynical frivolity to continue.
If Africa's oil wealth is to be exploited - and itwill be exploited ­- it is in the interest of oil importing countries to promote better government in Africa.
After all, the West is now paying a high price for allowing the ordinary people of the Middle East to live for so long in hopeless squalor while their rulers wallowed in oil wealth.
No one, least of all impoverished Africans, can afford to repeat that mistake.
Africa\u0027s Quest for Power
Why does Africa remain poor?
Civil war, famine, disease, the legacy of colonialism-all have been advanced as plausible reasons for the continent's grinding poverty and economic backwardness.
But another factor-probably related in some ways to these others-plays a fundamental role in stifling development: a lack of modern energy sources.
Africa's enormous energy potential remains vastly under exploited.
This is a key conclusion of the 2003/2004African Economic Outlook, published recently by the OECD. While almost half of Africa's 53 countries could profitably produce hydropower, only 7% of this potential is reached because of poor infrastructure and the high costs of initial investments.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Furthermore, despite its large geothermal and solar energy potential, Africa accounts for only 1.3% of the world's installed solar facilities, and only four countries have started exploiting underground heat sources.
Of the fossil energy sources - primarily oil - that African countriesdo exploit, only a quarter is consumed locally.
Limited energy development in Africa has resulted in one of the lowest uses of modern energy sources in the world.
More than three quarters of sub-Saharan Africans have no access to electricity, compared to fewer than 14% of Latin Americans and East Asians.
As a result, most Africans use biomass (animal and vegetable wastes and firewood) for lighting, cooking, and heating.
Families in rural and semi-rural areas often have no choice but to exploit what they perceive as a "free" energy source.
However, as populations grow and the need for energy increases, fragile ecosystems are threatened.
Replacing biomass sources by less destructive energy supplies has thus become increasingly urgent.
Clearly, African countries, assisted by their development partners, need to develop the continent's enormous energy potential as an integral part of their efforts to spur economic growth and reduce poverty.
Improvements in energy supplies have multiple beneficial effects. Public and home lighting, refrigeration of food, medicine and vaccines, and heating and proper sanitation help improve people's living conditions and health.
More and higher-quality energy increases production through modernized communications, improved productivity, and a better business environment.
A secure energy supply, moreover, greatly extends learning possibilities and improves access to information.
More informed citizens, in turn, participate at a higher rate and to a greater degree in their country's decision-making processes.
Thus, institutions are rendered more democratic and governments become more transparent and responsible.
Some countries have sought to bridge the gap between their energy potential and their populations' lack of access to energy.
In a few countries, private-sector participation in electricity companies, coupled with new independent regulators, has resulted in greater and more efficient power generation and higher employment, while doubling the number of subscribers.
Electrification for the rural poor has improved in South Africa and Ghana through the creation of independent agencies in charge of implementing rural electrification plans.
Similar policies need to be adopted by a greater number of countries to enable them to address their energy challenges in a more effective way.
More attention should also be given to regional and inter-regional power initiatives, which can help smooth out the uneven distribution of energy resources across countries.
Such reforms have the potential of benefiting consumers by lowering costs and improving the reliability and quality of services.
An integrated, continent-wide energy strategy, linked to national policies for growth would, indeed, go a long way toward addressing this important need.
One vehicle for promoting such an approach is the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).
The NEPAD Heads of States Implementing Committee has asked the African Development Bank to take the lead in regional infrastructure (including transport, energy, water, etc.) and banking and financial standards.
As part of the work on regional infrastructure, the Bank has developed a short-term action plan.
Several projects, including some in the energy sector, have been prepared or are under preparation, and four have already been approved for financing by the Bank.
Projects and programs identified in the short-term action plan are estimated to cost $7 billion.
In addition, work has also started in preparing a medium to long-term action plan in close collaboration with the regional economic communities and in cooperation with the World Bank and the European Union.
TheAfrican Economic Outlook estimates that Africa's GDP growth in 2003 stood at 3.6%, significantly higher than the 2.8% recorded in 2002.
Projections for 2004 indicate that faster growth is likely to continue, or even accelerate further, for the next two or three years.
But this is still not enough: it is generally acknowledged that average growth rates of around 6-8% are required if Africa is to make real headway in curtailing poverty.
More intensive use of Africa's energy resources will necessarily be a critical component of any realistic development strategy.
As Africa looks to the future, developing its enormous energy resources - through both national and regional efforts - must be given high priority.
Indeed, boosting its energy capacity will be critical to unleashing the continent's economic and human potential.
Africa’s Stolen History
NAIROBI – The news that Yale University has agreed to return thousands of artifacts that one of its researchers took from Peru in 1911 reminded me of a party that I attended recently – one that I had to leave prematurely.
An African friend had invited me to the event, at an acquaintance’s home.
The host, a wealthy American, proudly displayed his collection of paintings and sculptures.
As he showed us around, there was one object that appeared to be African, but I wasn’t sure; on occasion, I have identified art as African only to learn that it was, in fact, Native American.
The piece was an animal skin stretched and decorated with colored beads, and framed behind glass.
The beads were the same kind that my people, the Maasai, use, but the dominant color was blue, not our preferred red.
“Where is that from?” I asked, pointing at the piece on the wall.
“That is from Zimbabwe,” our host replied. “It’s a wedding skirt that was worn in a Ndebele royal wedding in 1931.”
For an African away from home, finding even the most insignificant African object on display can make you happy.
When I see Kenyan or Ethiopian coffee for sale in New York or Paris, for example, it makes me proud that there are Americans and Europeans who consider a product from my homeland valuable.
Learning that a wealthy American had found a traditional African skirt worthy of a place in his home triggered the same feeling.
But our host’s next remark erased it instantly.
He boasted that he had acquired the skirt illegally through a friend who had “paid” a Zimbabwean government official to smuggle it out of the country.
My friend and I looked at each other, trying hard not to show our disapproval.
“I’m so disgusted,” my friend said a moment later. “Let’s leave before I get drunk and say something inappropriate to this guy.”
We left the party.
On the way home, we ranted angrily about what we had witnessed.
But our contempt was driven more by the West’s role in supporting corruption in Africa than by the fate of the specific Zimbabwean artifact we had seen.
It wasn’t until I heard that Yale had returned the Peruvian objects that I began to think about African artifacts as culturally and historically important.
Many African artifacts have, of course, ended up in Western museums or in the hands of private Western collectors.
The pieces are largely the loot that Europeans pillaged from Africa during the slave trade and the colonial period.
Perhaps the most famous is the sculpture known as Bangwa Queen.
Valued at millions of dollars, it is the world’s most expensive piece of African art.
African art exhibitions usually include stories about each piece’s origins, which are often tied to an African kingdom.
But information about an artifact’s journey to the West is often vague or nonexistent.
For example, The New York Times published an article last year about an African art exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum.
The Times reported that the Bangwa Queen has been owned by many famous collectors “since she left her Cameroonian royal shrine in the late nineteenth century.”
In fact, the Bangwa Queen “left” Cameroon with Gustav Conrau, a German colonial explorer who later gave the statue to a museum in his home country.
Considering the suspect tactics that colonial agents typically used to separate Africans from their possessions, it is unlikely that the Bangwa Queen left willingly.
African artifacts on display in New York, London, Paris, and elsewhere have similar stories.
Peru’s reclamation of its cultural heritage made me wish the same for Africa’s looted artifacts.
But Peru is fundamentally different from any African country.
Its demand reflected a reverence for its past.
To Peruvians, the artifacts are a reminder of the great Inca civilization that European conquerors destroyed.
Africans, on the other hand, tend to discount their past.
To some extent, Africans appear to have internalized the condescending colonialist idea that Africa was primitive and needed to be civilized.
We don’t treasure our historical artifacts, because they remind us of our rich civilizations’ supposed inferiority.
It is no wonder that an object as culturally important as a royal wedding skirt can be smuggled out of a country without anyone noticing.
Until Africans recognize the value of their history, their cultures’ artistic output will continue to be up for grabs.
Africa’s Urban Farmers
NAIROBI – When I met Eunice Wangari at a Nairobi coffee shop recently, I was surprised to hear her on her mobile phone, insistently asking her mother about the progress of a corn field in her home village, hours away from the big city.
A nurse, Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming.
Even though Wangari lives in Kenya’s capital, she is able to reap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of relatives.
Her initial stake – drawn from her nursing wages of about $350 a month – has long since been recovered.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Wangari is one of thousands of urban workers in Kenya – and one of hundreds of thousands, even millions, across Africa – who are increasing their incomes through absentee agriculture.
With prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades, many urbanites feel well rewarded by farming.
Absentee agriculture also bolsters national pride – and pride in traditional diets – by specializing in vegetables specific to the region. “For too long our country has been flooded with imported food and Westernized foods,” Wangari says.
“This is our time to fight back – and grow our own.”
Across Africa, political leaders, long dismissive of rural concerns, have awakened to the importance of agriculture and the role that educated people, even those living in major cities, can play in farming.
In Nigeria, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has a huge diversified farm and has pushed for policies to help absentee farmers prosper.
In Uganda, Vice President Gilbert Bukenya routinely travels the country, promoting higher-value farming, such as dairy production.
Perhaps the most visible political support for absentee agriculture is in Liberia, a small West African country where civil war destroyed agriculture, rendering the population dependent on food imports, even today.
President Johnson-Sirleaf, recognizing that educated people could contribute much to an agriculture revival, launched her “Back to the Soil” campaign in June 2008 in large part to encourage urban dwellers to farm.
To be sure, absentee farming by elites and educated urban workers can’t solve all of Africa’s urgent food needs.
Moreover, absentee farmers face unexpected problems.
Because they don’t visit their fields often, they rely heavily on relatives and friends.  When I decided to farm wheat for the first time this spring on leased land in my childhood village, my mother agreed to supervise plowing, planting, and harvesting.
Without her help, I might not have farmed at all.
Even with mother’s help, I have worries.
Although I grew up around wheat fields, my knowledge of farming is thin.
Fertilizer and spraying were both more expensive than I thought.
While my wheat stalks are sprouting on schedule, I now fear that at harvest time – in November – prices will fall and I won’t recoup my costs.
One key tool is the mobile phone.
My hopes for success are buoyed by my ability to call my mother inexpensively and discuss the farm.
We even decided over the phone what kind of pesticide to use and which tractor company to hire.
Because they know both the tastes of fellow city dwellers and rural conditions, many urban farmers are succeeding.
In fact, some city dwellers don’t even bother with acquiring land or gaining distant help. Certain crops can be grown in their own homes.
James Memusi, an accountant, grows mushrooms in a spare bedroom, selling them to nearby hotels and supermarkets.
Nevertheless, most people living in Africa’s cities have access to land in the countryside, which is why Liberia’s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion.
In a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer, the authorities declared, “The soil is a bank; invest in it.”
In Liberia, the main push is to reduce imports of staples such as rice and tomatoes.
In more prosperous countries, African elites are motivated by a complex interplay of national pride, dietary concerns, and the pursuit of profit.
In Zambia, for example, Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants.
Now, ordinary Lusakans want to cook similar meals in their own homes, driving demand for farmers who produce such delicacies as dried pumpkin, “black jack” leaves, and fresh Okra.
Similarly, in Nairobi, Miringo Kinyanjui, another woman entrepreneur, is supplying unrefined – and more nutritious – maize and wheat flour.
In another move to distinguish her ingredients from Western versions, Kinyanjui also sells through grocery stores flour flavored with Amarathan, a green vegetable that grows around Kenya.
The revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations.
Last year, Unilever’s Kenyan branch ran a “taste our culture” campaign in support of its line of traditional East African herbs and spices.
Such campaigns go hand-in-hand with expanded farming, because sellers of these foods prefer nearby growers – even if these growers increasingly live in the city.
Africa’s Winds of Change Return
DAKAR – How did Ivory Coast come to this?
After gaining independence from France in 1960 with Felix Houphouet-Boigny as President, the country became the world’s largest exporter of cocoa beans and a significant exporter of coffee and palm oil.
Throughout the 1960’s and 1970’s, sizeable export earnings, combined with easy access to credit, fueled an economic surge dubbed the “Ivorian miracle.”
But then, escalating debts and plummeting commodity prices started taking their toll.
Africa’s El Dorado was lost.
In 1990, Houphouet-Boigny appointed Alassane Ouattara, the governor of the Central Bank of the West African States, as Prime Minister to fix Ivory Coast’s growing economic problems.
After Houphouet-Boigny’s death in 1993, Henri Konan Bédié assumed the presidency and revised the electoral code to bar Ouattara from entering the 1995 presidential contest on the grounds that he was not an Ivorian national.
Bédié, not surprisingly, was re-elected unopposed.
And, not surprisingly, he was soon accused of widespread corruption and toppled in a military coup in 1999.
It was in the midst of this militarization of Ivorian politics that Laurent Gbagbo emerged as the main opposition leader.
When Robert Guéi, the military leader, organized a flawed presidential election in 2000, of which he declared himself to be the winner, a popular uprising ousted him and elevated Gbagbo to the post.
In 2002, Ivory Coast was rocked by a rebel uprising that partitioned the country, with the government led by Gbagbo controlling the south, pro-Ouattara rebels controlling the north, and a French army camped between the two.
After a peace conference in 2005, a government of national unity was established, followed by a presidential election in November 2010.
The independent electoral commission endorsed by the international community declared Ouattara the winner.
Gbagbo refused to acknowledge the result, claiming vote-rigging, and was declared re-elected by the Constitutional Court, which nullified 600,000 ballots in several northern constituencies.
As a result, Ivory Coast was plunged in a deadly battle among four stakeholders.
The first stakeholder is Gbagbo, who sought to break away from French neo-colonial dominance. He had the support of Ivorians who aspired to install genuine Ivorian patriots in place of the French-backed elite.
Gbagbo was suspicious of Ouattara, whom he believed to be actively plotting with French support to topple his government.
But Gbagbo refused to denounce the tribal/religious chauvinism that excluded Ouattara and millions of Ivoirian northerners from full citizenship rights.
He also tried to avoid confrontation with France, awarding the management of the port of Abidjan, the capital, to a French company. But French President Nicolas Sarkozy maintained his visceral opposition to Gbagbo.
The second stakeholder is Ouattara.
In his quest for authority, he drew on the Western ties that he had forged as a deputy-managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
His claim to fame was his professional reputation as an economic manager, which arose from his implementation of structural adjustment programs that always included the same set of measures: currency devaluation, decontrol of exchange rates, tighter monetary policy, financial deregulation, trade liberalization, wage cuts, fiscal consolidation, and labor-market deregulation.
Ivory Coast’s third key stakeholder is France, which under President Charles de Gaulle had granted independence to its former African colonies on the condition that French troops remain stationed on their territories, and that their economies remain tightly linked to France.
Indeed, after a half-century of independence, France maintains a stranglehold on Ivorian commerce and holds its foreign-currency reserves.
French business, moreover, dominates most of the country’s infrastructure: Bolloré controls the port of Abidjan and the railway; Bouygues oversees Ivorian construction projects; Total holds one-quarter of the shares of the country’s oil refinery; France Telecom is the main shareholder of the landline and mobile telephone network; Société Générale and BNP-Paribas control the banking industry; and Air France controls the sky.
The convertibility of the country’s currency, the CFA franc, allows these companies to transfer freely all their earnings back to France.
The CFA’s fixed exchange rate peg to the euro shields them from any risk of capital loss at a time when countries around the world are battling to maintain competitive exchange rates in order to export their way out of economic trouble.
With such a currency regime in place, there is no prospect for proper industrialization in western Africa’s francophone countries, whose economic woes stand in sharp contrast to other reviving African economies.
The fourth stakeholder is the Ivorian population, which is under siege, divided along ethnic and religious lines, and incited by venomous politics.
Ivorians massacred each other in the 2002 civil war.
In 2011, the post-election deadlock led to thousands of civilian deaths.
A stream of refugees fled to neighboring countries, especially Liberia.
The mayhem began to abate only when Gbagbo was removed from power and taken prisoner after French and UN ground troops, armored vehicles, and helicopters bombarded the presidential palace where he was guarded by forces that remained loyal to him.
Elite corruption and incompetence, a population vulnerable to demagogic manipulation, and the ruthlessness of French neo-colonialism have combined to plunge francophone Africa into a deadly cycle of violence, humiliation, and hopelessness.
But the entry into Africa of fast-growing economies such as China, India, South Korea, Turkey, Brazil, and Malaysia reflects a shifting balance of power and the inception of a model of cooperation based on trade, investment, and technology transfer – in sharp contrast to French neo-colonial politics.
At the start of the era of decolonization, British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan famously said that “the winds of change” were blowing across Africa.
Another such wind is blowing today.
Will Francophone Africa at last escape its French enthrallment?
African Misrule on Trial
THE HAGUE – As the world focuses on the inauguration of America’s first black president and celebrates an important milestone in the ongoing struggle for racial equality, recent developments across the Atlantic represent significant progress in a related global campaign to end impunity for mass crimes.
In the coming days, judges sitting on the International Criminal Court in The Hague will decide whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for the crime of genocide.
And on January 26, the ICC will begin its first trial – that of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a former Congolese warlord.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Neither event is earth shattering, but, taken together, these two steps mean that a new system of international justice is working.
Government and rebel leaders around the globe have been put on notice that criminal conduct will no longer be given a free pass.
Although the threatened indictment of al-Bashir has prompted protest in Khartoum, no one expects him to appear in court soon.
As for Lubanga, he is one of many in the Congo who has used civilians as pawns in a war that has cost more than five million lives in the past decade.
Though serious, the charges against him – recruiting child soldiers – do not pretend to encompass the range of abuses committed.
Five years after the world’s first permanent criminal tribunal commenced operations, it has made its mark.
The ICC has opened four active investigations, issued public charges against twelve people, and to date secured custody of four.
Nonetheless, the Court has come under fire for three alleged failings.
First, some argue that by interjecting itself into ongoing conflicts, the ICC has impeded efforts to secure peace.
But the facts on the ground do not bear this out.
In northern Uganda, ICC charges against leaders of the rebel Lord’s Resistance Army have helped bring an end to years of brutal fighting, and marginalized the LRA’s chief, Joseph Kony.
Similarly, in Sudan’s Darfur region, there has been no genuine peace process to disrupt, as attacks on civilians continue to be reported, even after the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the ICC in 2005.
Even so, the ICC prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant for al-Bashir – announced this past July – has yet to provoke a widely-feared crackdown on humanitarian organizations.
On the contrary, it may have prompted the arrest of a lower-level indictee for crimes in Darfur.
In short, more law, rather than less, is needed to help stem the violence. 
Second, the ICC is said to have allowed itself to become a tool of national political leaders.
The fact that national governments referred three of the Court’s four active cases – and that in each of those cases only armed rebels or government opponents have been charged so far – has contributed to this perception.
Navigating this interplay between law and politics is perhaps the ICC’s greatest challenge.
On the one hand, the Court’s actions often have political consequences: however well-founded, accusing the leader of a rebel army may be seen as taking sides in a conflict.
On the other hand, the Court cannot charge – or refrain from charging – a senior political or military official responsible for grave crimes solely to avert negative political repercussions.
Nor would it be proper, where the gravity and scale of crimes materially differ, to charge all sides in a conflict in order to preserve a false sense of parity.
Both of these complaints reflect a third: unease with the Court’s overwhelming focus on Africa.
Some suggest that this is yet another example of Western institutions applying to Africa principles that they don’t apply to themselves.
The long history of Africa’s exploitation demands that this concern not be dismissed out of hand.
Nevertheless, Africa is the site of many of the world’s worst conflicts.
Nor is the ICC a foreign body.
Thirty African governments have ratified the ICC’s governing statute, and several of the Court’s 18 judges hail from Africa, as does a substantial portion of its staff.
Still, the Court should not hesitate to act outside Africa when mass atrocities demand redress.
The experience of other war crimes tribunals suggests that questions about political bias may take years to overcome.
Only by demonstrating professionalism in its work, and willingness to hold senior government figures accountable where appropriate, can the ICC engender broad and lasting support.
Over time, the ICC’s example should foster more effective national and regional prosecutions of serious crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
For now, the Court can best address skeptics by more regularly and transparently explaining itself – its decisions, its mandate, and its constraints – to a global public to whom it ultimately must answer.
After Assimilation
Human migration is as old as history.
Even migration to distant places and remote cultures is nothing new.
In the nineteenth century, millions of Europeans sought liberty and prosperity in the Americas, notably in the United States.
What is new today is the scale of migration, often across huge cultural divides - and often without a definite aim.
The African boat people in the Mediterranean are often not even sure whether they want to be in Italy, Germany, or Britain.
Even those who are certain, like North Africans in Spain and France, or Turks in Germany, had as their priority escaping the hopelessness of their home countries, not arriving at a particular destination.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });This modern form of migration raises massive problems for countries on the receiving end.
In Europe, it is probably the most serious social issue today, because no one has a clear idea about how to manage the resulting clash of cultures.
Once upon a time, North America, notably the US, seemed to provide the answer.
It was that of the "melting pot": different peoples made their own contribution to American culture, but, above all, they made every effort to accept what they found and integrate.
"No," the Russian woman who came to the US in the early twentieth century replied to the grandchild who asked whether her ancestors arrived with the Pilgrims on the Mayflower.
"Our ship had a different name, but now we are all Americans."
More recently, this has changed, giving rise to a process described by Arthur Schlesinger, the historian and former aide to President John F. Kennedy, in his bookThe Disuniting of America. No longer are all US citizens Americans.
They have become hyphenated Americans: Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and so on.
The ingredients of the melting pot are separating.
Even in Israel, the last true immigration country - at least for Jews - assimilation is no longer so easy.
Recent newcomers from Russia have their own political party, and old Europeans have become a distinct minority.
Israel and America continue to have mechanisms to integrate new migrants.
Language is an important underlying factor, and in Israel, there is the army, while in America, the values embodied in the Constitution still represent a shared secular faith.
But these mechanisms are weakening everywhere, and are virtually non-existent in European countries.
Modern societies are characterized by acute problems of belonging.
They don't offer the implicit, unconscious ties of community that citizens felt in the past.
As a result, people have begun to cling to other, more primordial group identities.
They resist assimilation, fearing that it will rob them of their identity without offering a new one.
What then is the alternative to assimilation?
The "salad bowl" of so-called multiculturalism is no real alternative, because it does not provide the necessary glue that binds communities together.
All the ingredients remain separate from the outset.
The only viable alternative for which there are examples is probably that of London or New York.
The main characteristic of this alternative is the coexistence of a common public sphere shared by all and a considerable degree of cultural separation in the "private" sphere, notably in residential areas.
The public space is multicultural in terms of people's backgrounds, but is governed by agreed values, even a common language, whereas the people's private lives are - to use an ugly word - ghettoized.
In theory, this is a distinctly second-best solution to the cultural consequences of migration; in practice it is the best answer we have.
But it cannot be had for nothing.
Even the necessary minimum of a common language requires a deliberate effort, to say nothing of certain rules of behavior.
Living in London, I marvel at the way in which we Londoners have come to terms with Indian family shops and West Indian-run public transport, while not asking many questions about whole districts that are Bangladeshi or Chinese.
No one has yet found a name for this new version of the "separate but equal" doctrine that some of us fought so hard against in the 1960's: separate private lives in a common public space that is equal for all.
This is clearly easier in London and New York than it is in smaller towns or even in the capitals of countries where the world language of English is not spoken.
Berlin's Turkish community and the North African communities around Paris seem increasingly separate, with their own public sphere and often language.
Where this happens, an explosive condition can arise, a kind of separatism within, not by historically separate groups but by newcomers against natives.
If we are forced to abandon the hope of assimilation, our efforts should concentrate on creating a public space to which all contribute and that all enjoy.
Ideally, this should be an expanding public space, for in the end, the element of unity in a modern society is the guarantee of its citizens' liberty.
After Austerity
NEW YORK – This year’s annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund made clear that Europe and the international community remain rudderless when it comes to economic policy.
Financial leaders, from finance ministers to leaders of private financial institutions, reiterated the current mantra: the crisis countries have to get their houses in order, reduce their deficits, bring down their national debts, undertake structural reforms, and promote growth. Confidence, it was repeatedly said, needs to be restored.
It is a little precious to hear such pontifications from those who, at the helm of central banks, finance ministries, and private banks, steered the global financial system to the brink of ruin – and created the ongoing mess.
Worse, seldom is it explained how to square the circle.
How can confidence be restored as the crisis economies plunge into recession?
How can growth be revived when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggregate demand, sending output and employment even lower?
This we should know by now: markets on their own are not stable.
Not only do they repeatedly generate destabilizing asset bubbles, but, when demand weakens, forces that exacerbate the downturn come into play.
Unemployment, and fear that it will spread, drives down wages, incomes, and consumption – and thus total demand.
Decreased rates of household formation – young Americans, for example, are increasingly moving back in with their parents – depress housing prices, leading to still more foreclosures.
States with balanced-budget frameworks are forced to cut spending as tax revenues fall – an automatic destabilizer that Europe seems mindlessly bent on adopting.
There are alternative strategies.
Some countries, like Germany, have room for fiscal maneuver.
Using it for investment would enhance long-term growth, with positive spillovers to the rest of Europe.
A long-recognized principle is that balanced expansion of taxes and spending stimulates the economy; if the program is well designed (taxes at the top, combined with spending on education), the increase in GDP and employment can be significant.
Europe as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape; its debt-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with that of the United States.
If each US state were totally responsible for its own budget, including paying all unemployment benefits, America, too, would be in fiscal crisis.
The lesson is obvious:&#160; the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
If Europe – particularly the European Central Bank – were to borrow, and re-lend the proceeds, the costs of servicing Europe’s debt would fall, creating room for the kinds of expenditure that would promote growth and employment.
There are already institutions within Europe, such as the European Investment Bank, that could help finance needed investments in the cash-starved economies.
The EIB should expand its lending.
There need to be increased funds available to support small and medium-size enterprises – the main source of job creation in all economies – which is especially important, given that credit contraction by banks hits these enterprises especially hard.
Europe’s single-minded focus on austerity is a result of a misdiagnosis of its problems.
Greece overspent, but Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt-to-GDP ratios before the crisis.
Giving lectures about fiscal prudence is beside the point.
Taking the lectures seriously – &#160;even adopting tight budget frameworks –&#160;can be counterproductive.
Regardless of whether Europe’s problems are temporary or fundamental – the eurozone, for example, is far from an “optimal” currency area, and tax competition in a free-trade and free-migration area can erode a viable state – austerity will make matters worse.
The consequences of Europe’s rush to austerity will be long-lasting and possibly severe.
If the euro survives, it will come at the price of high unemployment and enormous suffering, especially in the crisis countries.
And the crisis itself almost surely will spread.
Firewalls won’t work, if kerosene is simultaneously thrown on the fire, as Europe seems committed to doing: there is no example of a large economy – and Europe is the world’s largest – recovering as a result of austerity.
As a result, society’s most valuable asset, its human capital, is being wasted and even destroyed.
Young people who are long deprived of a decent job – and youth unemployment in some countries is approaching or exceeding 50%, and has been unacceptably high since 2008 – become alienated.
When they eventually find work, it will be at a much lower wage.
Normally, youth is a time when skills get built up; now, it is a time when they atrophy.
So many economies are vulnerable to natural disasters – earthquakes, floods, typhoons, hurricanes, tsunamis –&#160;that adding a man-made disaster is all the more tragic.
But that is what Europe is doing.
Indeed, its leaders’ willful ignorance of the lessons of the past is criminal.
The pain that Europe, especially its poor and young, is suffering is unnecessary.
Fortunately, there is an alternative.
But delay in grasping it will be very costly, and Europe is running out of time.
After Dictatorship
The war in Iraq had barely begun when the minds of those who conceived the invasion turned to what should happen after the victory over Saddam Hussein's regime-a victory everyone assumed to be inevitable.
Politicians and experts have invariably sought to draw comparisons with recent examples like Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, East Timor, but also with more remote and fundamental cases.
After all, what is expected in Iraq is the fall of a highly ideological dictatorship.
Is there anything we can learn from the last examples of this kind, from the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, or the end of the Third Reich in Germany in 1945 and the process of "de-Nazification" that followed?
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The risks of such comparisons are almost too obvious for words.
Every case has its own defining features. Regarding the demise of communism, the experiences of, say, Poland and Romania are profoundly different.
As we cross even more profound cultural boundaries, comparisons become still less relevant.
Yet there are a few issues that are common to the unraveling of most ideological dictatorships.
One such issue has to do with memory, and dealing with the past.
This is connected with a practical question: who is in a position to build a new country on the ruins of the old regime?
It is rare for a counter-elite to emerge quickly, much less for an elite-in-waiting to take over.
In Germany in the 1950s, there were many complaints about old Nazis reappearing in a democratic guise and occupying important positions.
Many of us fought against the apparent "restoration" of the old regime.
In Eastern Europe, the old leaders initially disappeared from the scene, but not for long.
Ex-communists were often reincarnated politically as social democrats.
Those who had been in the resistance-like Václav Havel in Prague-found this hard to take.
Yet these communist apparatchiks were not the same people they had been.
Circumstances had changed and the people with them.
This has a great deal to do with methods of dealing with the past.
Post-1945 Germany and post-1989 Poland are examples of countries that moved forward without much attention to the past.
Intellectuals complained that too little time and energy was spent on "mastering" the past.
They had good reasons to complain.
Indeed, after a decade or so, the need to draw clear lines and tell all, including the painful stories, became overwhelming.
But the most successful postcommunist countries moved forward first and coped with the past later.
Those who could not lift their eyes from the horrors of the past made less progress.
A second general issue has to do with priorities.
There is a natural tendency-especially in Anglo-Saxon countries-to regard elections as the most effective institutional remedy for countries emerging from ideological dictatorships.
To be sure, elections are important; but by themselves they do not solve problems.
Indeed, if they disappoint, the very principles on which they are based-democracy and civil liberties-will be discredited.
I am a strong, almost old-fashioned believer in parliamentary democracy, but when it comes to situations like postwar Iraq, two other imperatives are equally pressing.
One is the need to establish an effective administration to make certain that new policies of tolerance and market economics are actually implemented.
In East European countries, this was a major problem, and it is only through accession negotiations with the European Union that such administrative reform has been assured.
The second imperative is the rule of law.
The law has a different place in different cultures, and it presents special problems in Islamic countries.
However, it is crucial that every effort be made to educate and install an impartial and incorruptible judiciary.
Judges must not only be honest, but must be seen to be so and, as such, trusted.
The process of establishing the rule of law has been difficult and has remained incomplete in most post-dictatorial countries; yet it will be a key to successful recovery in Iraq as well.
One of the key points that I emphasized in my 1990 bookReflections on the Revolution in Europe is also valid for Iraq.
The road from the collapse of a dictatorial regime backed by ideology to a more liberal order leads through a valley of tears.
Things are likely to get worse before they get better.
This is notably the case in economic terms.
Even post-War Germany's acclaimed, miracle-working Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, was deeply unpopular in the early 1950s, because it appeared as if only a few were getting rich, while most West Germans remained poor or got poorer.
For a certain period in the process of recovery, it is simply necessary for people to keep their nerve.
Poland is a recent example of a country that achieved this feat.
It requires plausible leadership and the reasonable hope that things will get better before long.
If this time of transition goes wrong, the alternative is renewed turmoil and the victory of fundamentalists of one kind or another.
The warning "Beware of the valley of tears!" is thus the one that must be taken most seriously by those responsible for rebuilding an Iraq scarred by the terrors of dictatorship and the ravages of war.
After Kyoto
The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far.
Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations, including large emitters, in conversations about what to do after the treaty’s expiration in 2012.
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be discussed by the European Council next March.
While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries – 5.2% between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels, with varying targets for individual countries – real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning, and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and transport.
In other words, we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security.
At the end of the day, the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system, an incentives system, and investments in technology change.
Increasingly, adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding.
Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive, but complementary.
Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change.
Nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth’s temperature, and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level.
This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies – a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships.
Up to now, with only 15% of the world’s population, rich countries have been responsible for more than 75% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and thus most of the environmental damage.
However, it is the developing countries – and thus the world’s poor – who are most vulnerable.
It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies, to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change.
Working with partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change.
To date, over $1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants, together with about $8 billion in co-financing, have been committed to programs related to climate change.
While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future.
Without a regulatory framework beyond 2012, the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006/2007.
Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions, project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context.
Developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification, through licensing, financing, and construction, and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions.
Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007.
The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool, and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market.
The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities.
But, without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain, and the private sector – vital to the market’s success – is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way.
According to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance, only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions.
Now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community – with no exclusions, although with differentiated responsibilities – in the pursuit of a more secure world, one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction.
After Neoliberalism, What?
Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results.
Latin America, the region that tried hardest to implement the "Washington Consensus" recipes--free trade, price deregulation, and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth, with widening inequalities.
Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank.
The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism.
China, Vietnam, India: all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook, even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.
But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development, without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint, supposedly right for all countries at all times.
The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term, and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks.
The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy.
Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work.
An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks: encourage investment in non-traditional areas, and weed out projects and investments that fail.
For this, governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick.
Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development.
The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering, for example, that cut flowers, or soccer balls, or computer software can be produced at low cost, because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs.
The entrepreneur who makes the initial "discovery" can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him.
Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives.
In turn, the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments.
Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the fiscal system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector, and the underlying political economy.
Time-bound subsidy schemes, public venture funds, and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented, but there are many others.
No single instrument will work everywhere.
Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources.
The job can be done, but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship.
It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks:
Market-creating institutions (for property rights and contract enforcement);
Market-regulating institutions (for externalities, economies of scale, and information about companies);
Market-stabilizing institutions (for monetary and fiscal management);
Market-legitimizing institutions (for social protection and insurance).
Building and solidifying these institutions, however, takes time.
Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on.
A key point here is that institutional arrangements are, by necessity, country-specific.
Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation.
After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate.
Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others.
Such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies.
It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance.
While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice.
In fact, we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the "menu" of possible institutional arrangements in each area.
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.
It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes.
But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform.
Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it.
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy.
In both cases, it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse.
After Pax Americana?
NEW YORK – It has become popular to suggest that when the dust settles from the global financial crisis, it may become clear that the United States-led post-war world has come to an end.
If so, the global system that has secured peace, security, openness, and economic growth over the past six decades could be in grave danger.
Inspired by American leadership since World War II’s end, Europe, then Japan, then much of Asia and the world rose to new levels of prosperity; the world economy globalized upon the foundation of international institutions, norms, and standards; and foreign students educated in American universities returned home with new ideas about free markets, entrepreneurship, and democracy.
The US military’s protective umbrella gave large swaths of the world a vacation from war, making it easier for them to focus on economic growth and regional integration.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });America not only took the lead role in building the institutions of a globalizing world – the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, NATO– it also became the model that many other countries looked to for inspiration.
After eight years of compromised American leadership, a botched war of choice in Iraq, failure to take the lead in global efforts to address climate change, Abu Ghraib, Guantánamo Bay, running up a $10 trillion debt, and igniting a global financial crisis – America’s once-glittering model has lost a good deal of its luster and America’s leadership has been questioned by many.
The point was driven home at the 7th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Beijing this autumn, where European and Asian leaders began exploring ideas for a new global financial structure.
For much of the past 60 years, it would have been impossible to hold such a fundamental dialogue without US participation.
Today, it is almost becoming a new global norm that neither the international committee nor the US is prepared for.
Despite talk about American decline, the world is not prepared for a post-American era.
As irksome as some of America’s actions have been, particularly over the past eight years, America remains the world’s most critical champion of the progressive values that have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty and political repression.
If the US were to play a relatively smaller role in world affairs, and no other system was created to pick up the slack, these values could be at risk.
Although many states now hide behind an alleged universal principle of inviolable state sovereignty, for example, would the international community really want to go back to the old model where states did whatever they wanted to their citizens within the confines of their own borders?
Do countries around the world believe that they will be better off if the global trade system breaks down or international shipping lanes become less secure?
Are countries like China willing to step up and pay their fair share of dues to keep the UN running (China currently pays 2.1% of UN dues, compared to more than 25% for the US), or to capitalize revised international financial institutions or the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in a meaningful way?
Unless other countries become more willing to step forward for the common good, a post-American world could quickly become a far more frightening environment than what it would replace.
To make its case for a continued global leadership role, America must, however, step up to the plate.  While the go-it-alone impulse of the Bush administration has been discredited by its consequences, the inverse lessons regarding how important collaborative action is in today’s interconnected world are still being learned.
Even at the apex of American power, America’s greatness was always based on inspiring others, and the opportunities for building market share in that particular category remain unlimited.
It is impossible to overestimate how significant a step Barack Obama’s election is in this direction, but America’s actions over the coming years will be the ultimate determinant of whether the power of America’s model can be restored.
America can and should, for example, become the global leader combating climate change through major investments in alternative energy, conservation, and energy efficiency, and by taking strong actions at home to reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions.  It should transform its immigration policy to recruit the best and brightest people from around the world to move to the US and become citizens, and remain the world’s leading champion of open markets, especially during the current financial crisis.
Closing the prison at Guantánamo and reaffirming America’s commitment to international law and human rights will also be an important step in this direction.
The world wants to believe in an America that lives up to its own best values.
The prospect of a truly global community of nations working together to achieve the greater good for all is indeed exciting.
But, although America has been far from perfect over the last six decades, the end of thepax Americanahas the potential to create a dangerous void in international affairs.
If the world is going to shift in the direction of a new and more globally democratic system, other nations will need to meaningfully step forward to assume new responsibilities.
It is in America’s and the world’s interest that they do so.  The evidence of this will be seen not only in global institutions but also in places like Darfur, Zimbabwe, and Burma.
Until this happens, let us all hope that America can get back on track as the global champion of collaborative action to address the world’s greatest challenges and work with as many other countries  as possible to move collectively in the right direction.
After the Dear Leader
SEOUL – Korea is a unique country.
The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and is now remembered only as history to most people around the world.
The Korean Peninsula, however, remains divided along ideological lines, and the two Koreas co-exist as living remnants of the Cold War.
A total of almost 1.5 million young soldiers from both North and South Korea face off against each across the heavily armed Demilitarized Zone.
Events and structural forces, however, have affected and changed the nature of the North Korean system since 1991.
The sudden discontinuation of the supply of petroleum and natural resources from Russia in the early 1990’s, the failure of the centrally-planned economy, and the subsequent massive famine in the mid-1990’s left North Korea’s leaders no alternative but to tolerate informal market activities.
Nowadays, every North Korean seems to like money and know its value.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });The engagement policy pursued by the South Korean government in recent years also contributed to changes in North Koreans’ perceptions of the outside world and of their own abject economic situation.
In these desperate circumstances, North Korea’s leaders clung to their strategy of developing nuclear weapons as a last resort to defend the security of their regime.
But, regardless of whether the nuclear issue is resolved, the spread of market forces in North Korea will continue to change every aspect of life there in the coming years.
Nobody yet knows what the political consequences of these economic changes will be.
So, even before the recent reports of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s health problems, North Korea was already a country marked by growing uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the reports about Kim’s ill health hit like a rude wake-up call about the precarious nature of conditions in North Korea.
The “Dear Leader’s” declining health will add even more uncertainty and may cause international instability across East Asia.
For example, Kim Il Sung groomed his son Kim Jong-il as his successor for about two decades before the younger Kim took power in 1994.
Kim Jong-il, however, has not yet even chosen his successor.
Indeed, it is widely expected that a new system of collective leadership will emerge if Kim Jong-il is incapacitated.
The problem is that North Korea has no experience with collective leadership.
In the last six decades, all power has been concentrated in the hands of one person.
One-man rule has been so completely embedded in North Korea’s political culture and system that it is difficult to expect collective leadership to succeed.
Thus, some type of power struggle, rather like what occurred in the Soviet Union following Stalin’s death, may invariably follow a brief period of collective rule.
The dilemma for the world is that major decisions will have to be made during this period of instability.
Will the North’s would-be leaders be able to manage the country’s stock of nuclear weapons responsibly and safely without transferring a few of them abroad, much less respond to international pressure to dismantle them in a reasonable and flexible manner?
Over the past decade, Kim Jong-il has emphasized the importance of his military-first policy.
As a result, the army will be dominant in decision making on important issues like nuclear negotiations.
But the problem with military rule is a tendency toward incomplete understanding of the implications of political decisions – a problem that will be aggravated further by collective leadership.
Under a North Korean collective leadership dominated by the military, the power of the country’s economic bureaucrats will be marginal, at best.
This may lead to suppression of pressure from below for economic reform and opening.
As a result, the economy may worsen and political instability increase.
In such a difficult domestic situation, North Korea’s leaders may adopt more hostile policies to obtain economic aid from both South Korea and the United States.
Recently, South Korea’s government made it clear that it would continue to engage North Korea, but in a more principled way than had previous administrations.
This reflects a hardening of South Korean public opinion, following North Korea’s nuclear test in 2006.
As a result of this policy shift – and the recent killing of a South Korean tourist in North Korea’s Kumgang Mountains – official dialogue between North and South has stopped for the past several months.
International relations in northeast Asia will become more subtle and unstable as the Kim Jong-il era ends.
After six turbulent but somewhat predictable decades, we may be entering into a new era of greater turbulence but less predictability on the Korean Peninsula.
After the Death of Utopia
A decade ago, people spoke of the end of history, meaning the ultimate triumph of a liberal capitalist political order.
Nowadays, many scoff at that notion as too simplistic.
Nonetheless, we are at both the end and beginning of something remarkable.
In the wake of the death of the utopian - and often bloody - certainties of the 19th and 20th centuries (Communism's collapse was but the latest spectacular example), and with fading belief in the liberal welfare state, traditional views about work, retirement, education, the Church, solidarity, and other social institutions are changing rapidly.
The central driver of all this is today's enormous acceleration in the underlying pace of technological and economic change.
Call itfast-forward modernization.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Of course, the worldwide crash of high-tech stocks in 2000 chilled the hype about a "new economy" that seemed to be emerging at the "end of history."
But falling share prices should not blind us to the fact that on top of the ongoing information revolution, three fresh waves of revolutionary technology are poised to hit: bio-technology (including new medical technologies and genetic engineering, such as the creation of human embryos through cloning), nanotechnology, and robotics.
Each is its own industrial revolution, and will profoundly alter our lives and ways of thinking.
Indeed, the revolution is already upon us. For the first time in history, a global techno-market order is transforming the world of finance, business, politics and, indeed, physiology, beyond recognition.
This new techno-market system is shaped and characterized by a belief in the increasing importance of knowledge, new ideas, innovations and new technologies, and a higher pace of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called "creative destruction."
As a result, corporate capitalism is rapidly becoming obsolete, replaced by a creative capitalism in which entrepreneurship, combined with a greater willingness to adopt innovations, transforms the business landscape.
Innovative start-up firms become huge companies faster than ever before.
But these infant giants are quickly threatened with eclipse by even newer enterprises.
Take the example of computers.
It took 15 years for other countries to compete successfully with America's Silicon Valley in semi-conductors, but less than five years in Internet technology.
This system provides unprecedented financial incentives to scientists and entrepreneurs to aggressively develop new technologies and thus become rich.
But the revolution is not only for the elite; it also offers a realistic (non-utopian) promise of dramatically improved lives for many people around the entire globe - not in 100 years, but in the foreseeable future.
We are notjust witnessing a simple adaptation of social structures and ways of living to suit new technologies.
The Nobel laureate Robert Fogel argues that a new synergism between technological and physiological improvements has produced a radically new form of human evolution, which he callstechnophysio evolution.
Only this, Fogel believes, can explain recent trends in longevity, body size, the durability of vital organs, and chronic diseases.
These changes are also triggering changes in human consciousness.
The result is a litany of "post-utopian" values that include a stronger emphasis on individual freedom and personal responsibility.
In this world without utopia, individual freedom is the supreme value.
But, as with any change of such magnitude, there are holdouts.
Indeed, politics everywhere now seems dominated by the "war of lifestyles" that has emerged from today's emphasis on individual autonomy.
Not so long ago, issues such as the environment, the balance of work versus leisure in daily life, and the role of marriage, abortion, and other family concerns were secondary political disputes, as politicians fought over who would receive what share of a nation's wealth.
Now these issues define domestic political agendas.
Much of the new battle over lifestyles is undoubtedly misunderstood, perhaps because debates about them are conducted in a simplistic way: anti-global movements versus multi-nationals, environmentalists versus corporate polluters, small farmers versus agro-business, and so on. But, beyond slogans, there is an underlying fault line between those who have the cultural capacity to embrace change and those who resist it by adhering to traditional ideas about how one's life and, by extension, society, should be organized.
This conflict exists globally.
In societies that have been preparing themselves by opening their markets and embracing universal education, the disruptions of this revolution can probably be absorbed and handled.
Conflict is most acute in closed societies characterized by a politically repressive climate and culturally induced obstacles to growth.
Such obstacles include the absence of an informed and capable workforce, instinctive mistrust and rejection of new ideas and technologies just because they come from the West, lack of respect for those who acquire new knowledge, and endemic discrimination against women.
The new battle of lifestyles has given rise to new enemies of open societies, such as the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
It is no coincidence that terrorism thrives in societies that are intrinsically hostile to today's modernizing values and belief in individual autonomy.
So long as these ideas clash, violence will lurk.
To defend post-utopian values in the longer-term, politicians (and generals and spymasters) cannot seek security by drastically curtailing fundamental freedoms, because to do so risks forfeiting public support and a weakening of the pillars of the post-utopian market order.
In challenging groups like Al Qaeda, they must understand that they are engaged in a war of ideas; winning the hearts - and the lifestyles - of societies is the only way to win that battle.
After the Golden Age of Finance
LONDON – Even after the passage of new financial regulations in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the publication of the Basel Committee’s new capital requirements, the financial sector’s prospects over the next few years remain highly uncertain.
There has been some recovery in prices for bank shares from the lows of 2008, of course, but that rally faltered recently.
Quite apart from their concerns about the robustness of the rebound in the economy, investors are uncertain about many financial firms’ business models, and about the future size, shape, and profitability of the financial sector in general.
After all, banks remain deeply unpopular in all developed countries.
Bankers are still social pariahs, as lowly valued by the public as drug dealers or journalists.
They are reviled if they lose money, and assailed if they make it.
For banks and their shareholders, it looks a case of heads they win, tails we lose.
Thus, as banks return to profitability, politicians in North America and Europe have begun to talk again about new taxes that would skim those profits off to the benefit of taxpayers, whose support kept banks in business at the height of the crisis.
This is a huge contrast with the financial sector’s position in the previous three decades.
From the late 1970’s until 2007, the financial sector grew far more rapidly than the real economy.
In 1980, financial assets – stocks, bonds, and bank deposits – totaled around 100% of GDP in the advanced economies.
By 2007, the figure was over 400% in the US, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
During this period, credit expanded rapidly as a share of GDP, reaching more than 300% at the peak.
In the UK, the profits of financial intermediaries, which had averaged around 1.5% of the whole economy’s profits in the 1970’s, reached 15% in 2008.
In the US, bank profits were an even larger share of the total.
This was the golden age of finance.
Bankers’ pay soared alongside profits – indeed, it grew even faster.
To paraphrase William Wordsworth, bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, and to be a derivatives trader was very heaven.
But the expansion came to a shuddering halt in 2008, the first year in decades in which aggregate financial assets fell, and there is still little sign of a sustained recovery.
Is this a short-term phenomenon?
Will the financial sector return to pre-crisis growth rates when the economic situation has been fully stabilized?
Will financial “deepening” continue?
Will bank stocks once again outperform the market?
A recent study by Andy Haldane and others at the Bank of England casts doubt on the prospect of a return to the status quo ante.
They note that the Golden Age was in fact an unusual period, if you look at the last two centuries of economic history.
Haldane bases his analysis on the trend in the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the financial sector.
Over the last 160 years, the GVA of finance has grown by two percentage points a year faster than that of the economy as a whole.
But this excess growth has not been evenly spread.
During the two decades leading up to World War I, the financial sector grew almost four times faster than the economy, in the first wave of financial deepening and globalization, but from 1918 until the 1970’s, finance expanded less rapidly than average economic growth.
Only when markets were deregulated and liberalized from the early 1970’s onwards did finance once again leap ahead.
In the US, financial sector GVA was only 2% of the total in the 1950s, but stands at 8% today.
Haldane believes that this growth spurt is well and truly over.
He argues that much of the apparent growth in value added has in fact been illusory, based on increased leverage, excess trading, and banks writing deep out-of-the-money options – for example, credit-default swaps (a $60 trillion market in 2007). “What all these strategies had in common,” writes Haldane, “was that they involved banks assuming risk in the hunt for yield – risk that was often disguised because it was parked in the tail of the return distribution.”
From a regulator’s perspective, this is a powerful argument for requiring higher capital to constrain the risk that banks can take on.
Indeed, the Basel Committee plans to require more capital in the future, though the new requirements will be delayed, owing to concerns about the cost and availability of credit to sustain the recovery.
Against that background, it is hard to believe that we will quickly return to the heady growth in financial assets, credit, and risk we saw from the 1970’s to 2007.
Financial-sector returns are likely to be lower.
Returns of 20% on equity targets are a thing of the past.
And lower profitability will reduce pay more effectively than any direct regulatory controls.
For most of us, unless we remain seriously overweight in financial stocks, this may not be a bad prospect.
We do not want to inflate another asset-price bubble on the scale of the one that burst in 2007-2008.
But there is a risk for regulators and central banks.
If they over-constrain the financial sector, risk may migrate outside the regulatory frontier, where it will be harder to measure and monitor.
That is why it is important to maintain some flexibility, to allow currently unregulated institutions like hedge funds and private-equity funds to be swept into the regulatory net if they become large and systemically important.
The tighter their controls on risk in banks, the more frontier police the regulators will need.
After the Greek Default
CAMBRIDGE – The Greek government, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund are all denying what markets perceive clearly: Greece will eventually default on its debts to its private and public creditors.
The politicians prefer to postpone the inevitable by putting public money where private money will no longer go, because doing so allows creditors to maintain the fiction that the accounting value of the Greek bonds that they hold need not be reduced.
That, in turn, avoids triggering requirements of more bank capital.
But, even though the additional loans that Greece will soon receive from the European Union and the IMF carry low interest rates, the level of Greek debt will rise rapidly to unsustainable levels.
That’s why market interest rates on privately held Greek bonds and prices for credit-default swaps indicate that a massive default is coming.
And a massive default, together with a very large sustained cut in the annual budget deficit, is, in fact, needed to restore Greek fiscal sustainability.
More specifically, even if a default brings the country’s debt down to 60% of GDP, Greece would still have to reduce its annual budget deficit from the current 10% of GDP to about 3% if it is to prevent the debt ratio from rising again.
In that case, Greece should be able to finance its future annual government deficits from domestic sources alone.
But fiscal sustainability is no cure for Greece’s chronically large trade deficit.
Greece’s imports now exceed its exports by more than 4% of its GDP, the largest trade deficit among eurozone member countries.
If that trade gap persists, Greece will have to borrow the full amount from foreign lenders every year in the future, even if the post-default budget deficits could be financed by borrowing at home.
Eliminating or reducing this trade gap without depressing economic activity and employment in Greece requires that the country export more and import less.
That, in turn, requires making Greek goods and services more competitive relative to those of the country’s trading partners.
A country with a flexible currency can achieve that by allowing the exchange rate to depreciate.
But Greece’s membership in the eurozone makes that impossible.
So Greece faces the difficult task of lowering the prices of its goods and services relative to those in other countries by other means, namely a large cut in the wages and salaries of Greek private-sector employees.
But, even if that could be achieved, it would close the trade gap only for as long as Greek prices remained competitive.
To maintain price competitiveness, the gap between Greek wage growth and the rise in Greek productivity – i.e., output per employee hour – must not be greater than the gap in other eurozone countries.
That will not be easy.
Greece’s trade deficit developed over the past decade because Greek prices have been rising faster than those of its trading partners.
And that has happened precisely because wages have been rising faster in Greece, relative to productivity growth, than in other eurozone countries.
To see why it will be difficult for Greece to remain competitive, assume that the rest of the eurozone experiences annual productivity gains of 2%, while monetary policy limits annual price inflation to 2%.
In that case, wages in the rest of the eurozone can rise by 4% a year.
But if productivity in Greece rises at just 1%, Greek wages can increase at only 3%.
Any higher rate would cause Greek prices to rise more rapidly than those of its eurozone trading partners.
So Greece faces a triple challenge: the fiscal challenge of cutting its government debt and future deficits; the price-level challenge of reducing its prices enough to wipe out the current trade gap; and the wage-productivity challenge of keeping future wage growth below the eurozone average or raising its productivity growth rate.
Ever since the Greek crisis began, the country has shown that it cannot solve its problems as the IMF and the European Commission had hoped.
The countries that faced similar problems in other parts of the world always combined fiscal contractions with currency devaluations, which membership in a monetary union rules out.
A temporary leave of absence from the eurozone would allow Greece to achieve a price-level decline relative to other eurozone countries, and would make it easier to adjust the relative price level if Greek wages cannot be limited.
The Maastricht treaty explicitly prohibits a eurozone country from leaving the euro, but says nothing about a temporary leave of absence (and therefore doesn’t prohibit one).
It is time for Greece, other eurozone members, and the European Commission to start thinking seriously about that option.
After the Millennium Development Goals
CAMBRIDGE – In 2000, 189 countries collectively adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which evolved into a set of concrete targets called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
These ambitious targets – ranging from halving extreme poverty and reducing maternal mortality by three-quarters to achieving universal primary schooling and halting (and beginning to reverse) the spread of HIV/AIDS – are supposed to be met by the end of 2015.
As the deadline approaches, development experts are debating a new question: What comes next?
It is virtually certain that many of the MDGs will not have been met by the end of 2015, but there have been striking successes in some areas. For example, the goal of halving extreme poverty (measured by the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day) will likely be achieved ahead of time, largely thanks to China’s phenomenal growth.
At the same time, there is little evidence to suggest that those successes were the result of the MDGs themselves.
China implemented the policies that engineered history’s greatest poverty eradication program prior to, and independently from, the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs.
Clearly, however, the MDGs were a public-relations triumph, which is not to belittle their contribution.
Like all worthwhile PR efforts, the MDGs served to raise awareness, galvanize attention, and mobilize action – all for a good cause.
They amplified the global conversation about development and defined its terms.
And there is evidence that they got advanced countries to pay more attention to poor nations.
Indeed, the MDGs possibly had their clearest impact on aid flows from rich to poor countries.
A study by Charles Kenny and Andy Sumner for the Center for Global Development in Washington, DC, suggests that the MDGs not only boosted aid flows, but also redirected them toward smaller, poorer countries, and toward targeted areas like education and public health.
However, aid was not directly linked to performance and results, and it is much more difficult to know whether it had the desired impact overall.
The MDGs encompass eight goals, 21 targets, and 60 indicators.
Much criticism has focused on the use of these numerical targets and indicators, which, skeptics argue, are misspecified, mismeasured, and divert attention from equally important areas.
But these complaints miss the point.
Any effort that is concrete and implementable needs to monitor the results, and setting clear numerical targets is the best way to do so.
Still, a central paradox plagues the MDGs.
The Millennium Declaration was meant to be a compact between the world’s rich and poor countries.
Poor countries promised to refocus their development efforts while rich countries pledged to support them with finance, technology, and access to their markets.
But, oddly, of the eight goals, only the last one deals with “global partnership,” or what rich countries can and should do.
Even here, the MDGs contain no numerical target for financial aid or any other aspect of rich countries’ assistance, in contrast to the highly specific poverty-related targets set for developing countries.
It is perhaps telling that the “progress charts” prepared by the United Nations Development Program, the agency charged with reporting on progress toward achieving the MDGs, track only Internet usage under that goal.
Why we need a global effort to convince developing countries to do what is good for them is not clear.
Poverty reduction and human development should be the first order of business for governments in these countries, with or without the MDGs.
It is true, of course, that these governments often pursue different goals, for political, military, and other reasons.
But it is wishful thinking to believe that they can be persuaded to act otherwise by international declarations that lack enforcement mechanisms.
If we have learned one thing in the development business, it is that real reform cannot be bought with donors’ money, let alone with vague promises of money.
Equally problematic, the MDGs implicitly assume that we know how to achieve development targets, and that only resources and political will are missing.
But it is doubtful that even well-intentioned policymakers have a good handle on, say, how to raise secondary-school completion rates sustainably or reduce maternal mortality.
Many development economists would argue that significant improvements in governance and political institutions are required before such goals can be achieved.
The most that rich countries can do is to provide an enabling environment for the benefit of developing countries that are willing and able to take advantage of it.
These considerations suggest an obvious direction for the next iteration of the MDGs.
First, a new global compact should focus more directly on rich countries’ responsibilities.
Second, it should emphasize policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal, if not greater, impact on poor countries’ development prospects.
A short list of such policies would include: carbon taxes and other measures to ameliorate climate change; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations; reduced support for repressive regimes; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoidance.
Notice that most of these measures are actually aimed at reducing damage – for example, climate change, military conflict, and financial crime – that otherwise results from rich countries’ conduct.
“Do no harm” is as good a principle here as it is in medicine.
This kind of reorientation will not be easy.
Advanced countries are certain to resist any new commitments.
But most of these measures do not cost money, and, as the MDGs have shown, setting targets can be used to mobilize action from rich-country governments.
If the international community is going to invest in a bold new public-relations initiative, it might as well focus on areas where the potential payoffs are the greatest.
After the Promised Land
LONDON – At the height of the Arab uprisings last spring, many Europeans were gripped by nightmare visions of a tsunami of migrants crashing against the continent’s shores.
The wave never hit, but its specter fed a tenacious anti-immigrant populism that has concealed an important new trend: migration to Europe – and to the United States – has largely stalled.
In many countries, more immigrants are leaving than are arriving, owing mainly to the economic crisis that has drained jobs in the West.
That reversal is one of the great under-reported stories of 2011 (and of the preceding two years), and the numbers are startling.
Consider Spain, which is on track to lose more than a half-million residents by 2020.
By contrast, between 2002 and 2008, Spain’s population grew by 700,000 a year, driven largely by immigration.
The trends are similar elsewhere in Europe.
While this fact alone will not quiet opponents of immigration, it does give countries more breathing room to repair and strengthen badly broken systems for receiving and integrating newcomers.
Although rapidly aging Western countries are unable to attract the immigrants they need, they allow millions who are already there to suffer discrimination and abuse.
Detentions and deportations take place under sometimes terrible conditions.
Meanwhile, the international community collectively fails to protect vast populations of vulnerable migrants, such as the millions stranded by the recent conflicts in North Africa.
Undoubtedly, rising anti-immigrant populism must be confronted.
While polling suggests that attitudes are influenced more by ethnicity than religion, both help to define identities and mindsets.
Political parties in France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands (to name a few) have run successful campaigns that scapegoat immigrants.
Moreover, governments from Alabama to Hungary are passing laws that undermine what should be migrants’ rights.
Italy recently adopted harsh “emergency” decrees that target migrants by making undocumented entry and residence a criminal offense.
Anti-immigrant rhetoric from the political extremes has fed into mainstream political discourse.
European leaders trip over themselves to declare, one more forcefully than the next, that multiculturalism is dead.
Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose Freedom Party is informally part of the governing coalition, did them one better by being charged with incitement to anti-Muslim hatred.
In the US, alligator-filled moats and electrified border fences have featured in the current presidential campaign.
Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification, but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis.
Growing discrimination in employment, housing, and education affects not just immigrants and their children; it harms our societies as a whole.
With the lull in net immigration, we now have a window of opportunity to address these shortcomings.
Debunking the myths about migration – that most immigrants enter unlawfully, for example, or that immigration displaces existing workers – would be a good place to start.
It would also be useful to explain that immigration is necessary for prosperity and growth in almost all OECD countries.
If aging societies in the West and elsewhere (like Japan) fail to get immigration right, they will be woefully unprepared when they confront the real tidal wave: the retirement of baby boomers in the coming two decades.
The gaps in these countries’ labor markets – from software specialists to physicians to home health aides – will be immense.
The European Union’s labor force will decline by almost 70 million workers in the next 40 years; in the absence of significant net immigration (combined with a much higher retirement age), European economies and social safety nets will shrivel.
The priorities are clear.
We need to understand better how our economies will evolve in the coming decades, and to redesign our educational systems to produce workers with usable skills.
And, where it is clear that immigrants will be needed, we must be able to identify, welcome, integrate, and protect them.
Meanwhile, our most fundamental institutions – schools, police, and the courts – must be re-engineered to reflect and respond to the diversity of our communities, which is now a fact of life.
Countries must learn to work together to achieve these goals, few of which can be reached by going it alone.
If our toolbox were empty, our inaction might be understandable.
But examples of smart migration practices abound.
Canada and the Philippines, for instance, have a well-functioning accord that protects the rights of temporary workers.
Sweden has developed legislation that minimizes bureaucracy for companies that need foreign workers.
And important advances have been made in ensuring that immigrant children receive the education that they need to become full members of society.
Progress is being made on the global level as well, despite the economic crisis and populist headwinds.
In June, the International Labor Organization’s member states overwhelmingly approved the Domestic Workers Convention, which will significantly increase protections for a vulnerable group of workers –&nbsp;the majority of whom are migrants.
Meanwhile, the Global Forum on Migration and Development, established in 2007, has quickly become an important means of fostering knowledge and partnerships.
The reason for growing international cooperation is simple: countries everywhere are affected by migration, and, increasingly, they are experiencing immigration and emigration simultaneously.
Indeed, roughly one-third of migrants nowadays move between developed countries; one-third move between developing countries; and only one-third move from the developing to the developed world.
Highly skilled workers, such as bankers and engineers, are flocking to China.
Mexico, known primarily as a country of emigration, is home to millions of migrants from Central America.
Millions of people in Southeast Asia venture to the Middle East to work, but millions more cross borders within the region.
The list goes on.
When it comes to migration, we are all in the same boat – and that boat is leaking.
Starting in 2012, countries should redouble their efforts to fix it.
After the Taliban
``Failed state'' is a term applied frequently to Afghanistan and is often deemed the cause for why terrorists gained such influence there.
But a country does not fail of its own volition, nor is it weakened by unknown causes.
A country fails, when it fails, for definite, identifiable reasons.
These must be addressed if Afghanistan is to be revived.
Twenty years of invasion, civil war, and drought have left Afghanistan's institutions in ruin.
Millions of Afghans huddle in refugee camps or are displaced from their homes.
Land-mines defile the countryside.
Millions are sick and poor; many live at starvation levels.
For these and many other reasons, rebuilding Afghanistan's economy will require not only economic reconstruction but an effort to reinvent the country's political and cultural institutions.
Such a massive effort will be doomed to failure, however, if Afghanistan's neighbors intervene in ways that promote economic upheaval all over again.
googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('Mpu'); });Afghanistan is no place for quick fixes.
Rebuilding the country cannot be done cheaply.
Any thought that the anti-terror coalition will be able to bail out fast (as the West did when it abandoned Afghanistan to its fate after the Soviet withdrawal ten years ago) should be forgotten.
The West must stick with Afghanistan until its reconstruction is established.
Otherwise, it runs the risk of renewed chaos and violence, but this time in a more destabilized region, as Pakistan's current problems demonstrate.
Three problems are of immediate concern, the most important being feeding the Afghan people - both within the country and in refugee camps outside Afghanistan.
Humanitarian aid is being delivered, but a distribution system safe from the predations of Afghanistan's warlords needs to be built.
Indeed, the warlords have been given too big a say in distributing aid already, and it may be hard to strip them of this power.
But stripped they must be.
The second problem involves relocating Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan and Iran, as well as those displaced within Afghanistan.
To achieve this goal, the agricultural economy must be revived in order to revive this industry, providing jobs and food for people.
A massive impediment here is the millions of mines left over from the Soviet invasion that must be removed.
The West has a big incentive to be generous to Afghanistan's rural poor. Starving farmers, if unassisted, may return to cultivating a very reliable cash crop: the opium poppy, long a staple of the warlord economy.
Eliminating it will not only help farmers and the West as it tries to curtail heroin use, but also Afghanistan's infant government as it struggles to assert its national authority against the warlords.
A bankrupt warlord, after all, cannot buy weapons or bribe people to maintain their loyalty.
Major infrastructure investments will also be needed if the economy is to be revived.
Housing, particularly for returning refugees, will need to be constructed fast.
Cities such as Kabul, Mazar, Herat and others will need to be rebuilt as centers of economic and cultural life.
Village housing must be provided at a massive level.
Roads, airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored.
The educational system needs to be rebuilt almost from scratch, and with so many women anxious to return to teaching, a revived educational system will also help Afghanistan's democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers.
Particular attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of cities.
Afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction, as it is not a society with a strong political center.
Planners should take advantage of the country's decentralized nature and emphasize private sector participation in reconstruction.
A decentralized system will respond better to local needs and avoid an over-bureaucratic public sector.
But autonomous economic regions should be avoided as a threat to Afghan national unity because they would play into the hands of the warlords.
Moreover, poorer regions would do badly in such a system.
In the long run, Afghanistan has resources that can be exploited.
There is the potential for oil and gas exploration, and of mining iron ore and precious metals.
These activities should be explored in a framework of economic development across Central Asia.
Afghanistan, indeed, must be integrated into the regional pipeline and other development schemes.
Afghans can contribute in a tangible way here by reopening the North-South route connecting the resource rich economies of Central Asia to densely populated India and Pakistan.
None of this will be possible unless Afghanistan's young males are disarmed and given productive work.
Essential here, is to attract expatriate Afghans with skills and professional achievements to help in rebuilding the country by establishing small firms that will suck up the unemployed.
Expatriate involvement will also likely support the rights of women to participate fully and legally in economic and political life, as was the case before 1978.
Finally, donor countries must apply the lessons learned in restoring the war-ravaged states of the former Yugoslavia.
Grants and planning must be coordinated, and the consent of Afghanistan's neighboring countries assured.
If the latter are ignored, regional interests can incite chaos once again.
An international conference on Afghanistan should be called by the US and held under UN auspices. It must affirm not only Afghanistan's territorial integrity, but insure that donor commitments meet the scale of the job and that these promises are kept.
A decade ago, the West turned its back on Afghanistan and chaos ensued.
To abandon the country again would be criminal folly.
Against Simplification
NEW YORK – It is said that Americans have a genius for simplification.
Gradually, however, the quest for it has become a global trend, one that continues to conquer new territories, just as blue jeans once did.
The speed of our daily life is visibly increased – and not for the better – by this unstoppable evolution.
The tyranny of pragmatism seems to mark all of the complex dilemmas of our time.
Too many valid choices are ignored or skirted through the routine of short-cuts.
Nowhere is this trend more damaging than in today’s mercantile approach to art.
Even the much-praised notion of competition seems fake and cynically manipulated by the “corporate” mentality that now pervades the world of culture – by the financial pre-selection that determines what publishers, producers, and other impresarios will support.
Just imagine what might have happened with the works of, say, Proust, Kafka, Musil, Faulkner, or Borges had they been subjected to mass-market competition like shoes or cosmetics.
Culture is a necessary pause from the daily rat race, from our chaotic and often vulgar political surroundings, and it is a chance to recover our spiritual energy.
Great books, music, and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty, truth, and good, but also a way of discovering our own beauty, truth, and good – the potential for change, of bettering ourselves and even some of our interlocutors.
If this respite and refuge is gradually narrowed and invaded by the same kind of “products” as those that dominate the mass market, we are condemned to be perpetual captives of the same stunted universe of “practicalities,” the ordinary agglomeration of clichés packaged in advertisements.
I was thinking again about these old and seemingly unsolvable questions during my re-reading of a quite challenging novel by a close friend and a great writer, not very present in the vivid landscape of American letters of today.
The theme, style, and echo of his work says a lot, I think, about our simplified world.
The novel is Blinding, by Claudio Magris.
Hailed in Europe as one of the great novels of the twentieth century, Blinding arrived in America only after a great delay, and never received the attention that it deserved.
Unfortunately, that is no surprise.
The number of literary translations done nowadays in the United States is, according to a United Nations report, equal to that of Greece, a country one-tenth the size.
Imported books are thought to be too “complicated,” which is another way of saying that literature should deal with simple issues in a simple way, obeying the rules of the mass market, with its tricks of packaging, accessibility, advertisement, and comfort.
At the core of Magris’ book is the destiny of a group of Italian communists who travel to Yugoslavia after the Second World War to contribute to the construction of a socialist society, only to be caught in the conflict between Stalin and Tito.
They are imprisoned for their Stalinist allegiance; when they are finally allowed to return to Italy, their old comrades refuse to accept them.
The book’s plot spans two centuries of revolution.
Then, suddenly,
“the party vanished, overnight, as if all of a sudden a giant sponge had drained the entire sea, Adriatic and Austral, leaving litter and clots of mud, and all the boats stranded.
How can you go home again if the sea has been sucked down a vast drain that opened up beneath it, emptying it who knows where, into a void?
The earth is arid and dead, but there won’t be another one, nor another heaven.”
The solitude of the individual facing his faith alone, without collective illusions, and forced to do something with himself in the arid, noisy world tells us something important about the exiled world of modernity and its complex and contradictory problems.
Magris’s novel is not only an important literary achievement; it also has a deep connection to the dangers that we face now, particularly the wave of fanaticism, from Mumbai to Oslo, in the name of a holy war against the “other.” Are all the extremists searching for a new coherence, for a lost illusion of togetherness and a new hope of resurrection?
Can we ever forget September 11, 2001, the start of a bloody century in which the mystical force of hatred and destruction has recovered its strength?
Are Osama Bin Laden’s minions, the bloody Hamas-Hezbollah battalions, or troubled loners like Timothy McVeigh, Theodore Kaczynski, and now Norway’s Anders Behring Breivik, the “heroes” of our contemporary nightmare?
Is this the “rebel” response to an overly globalized, incoherent, and ultimately disturbing reality?
If so, their barbarism demands scrutiny – in relation to both historical precedent and to our modernity – rather than merely being labeled “monstrous” (though it certainly is that).
The new religious militants, fighting in the name of their particular and peculiar God, seem as fanaticized as the Fascists, Nazis, and Communists of earlier decades.
Magris’s main character is a rebel in more than one embodiment: as Salvatore Cipico, one of the inmates in the communist concentration camp in Yugoslavia; as Jurgen Jurgensen,  ephemeral king of Iceland and a convict forced to build his own jail; and as Jason, the mythic adventurer searching for the volatile truth.
A multilayered and complex chronicle of the devastating tragedies of the twentieth century, Blinding is an insistent, informed, and irreplaceable incursion into the moving landscape of the human soul, its wounds and voids, its vitality and versatility, its deep distortions and its unpredictable dynamics.
It is a fascinating story about the conflict between ideals and reality, or Utopia and humanness; about being faithful to a cause and betraying it; and about sacrifice and solidarity.
It is also a rich and original literary achievement that challenges today’s consumerist ethic.
By renouncing simplicity, it also repudiates today’s prevailing confusion of information with literature, of facts with creativity, and best-selling products with true works of art.
Ethics and Agriculture
MELBOURNE – Should rich countries – or investors based there – be buying agricultural land in developing countries?
That question is raised in Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South, a report issued last year by the Land Matrix Partnership, a consortium of European research institutes and nongovernmental organizations.
The report shows that since 2000, investors or state bodies in rich or emerging countries have bought more than 83 million hectares (more than 200 million acres) of agricultural land in poorer developing countries. This amounts to 1.7% of the world’s agricultural land.
Most of these purchases have been made in Africa, with two-thirds taking place in countries where hunger is widespread and institutions for establishing formal land ownership are often weak.
The purchases in Africa alone amount to an area of agricultural land the size of Kenya.
It has been claimed that foreign investors are purchasing land that has been left idle; thus, by bringing it into production, the purchases are increasing the availability of food overall.
But the Land Matrix Partnership report found that this is not the case: roughly 45% of the purchases involved existing croplands, and almost a third of the purchased land was forested, indicating that its development may pose risks for biodiversity.
The investments are both private and public (for example, by state-owned entities) and come from three different groups of countries: emerging economies like China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Malaysia, and South Korea; oil-rich Gulf states; and wealthy developed economies like the United States and several European countries.
On average, per capita income in the countries that are the source of these investments is four times higher than in the target countries.
Most of the investments are aimed at producing food or other crops for export from the countries in which the land is acquired, for the obvious reason that richer countries can pay more for the output.
More than 40% of such projects aim to export food to the source country – suggesting that food security is a major reason for buying the land.
Oxfam International calls some of these deals “land grabs.”
Its own report, Our Land, Our Lives,indicates that, since 2008, communities affected by World Bank projects have brought 21 formal complaints alleging violations of their land rights.
Oxfam, drawing attention to large-scale land acquisitions that have entailed direct rights violations, has called on the Bank to freeze investments in land purchases until it can set standards ensuring that local communities are informed of them in advance, with the option of refusing them.
Oxfam also wants the Bank to ensure that these land deals do not undermine either local or national food security.
In response, the World Bank agreed that there are instances of abuse in land acquisition, particularly in developing countries in which governance is weak, and said that it supported more transparent and inclusive participation.
At the same time, it pointed to the need to increase food production to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive in 2050, and suggested that more investment in agriculture in developing countries is required to improve productivity.
The Bank rejected the idea of a moratorium on its own work with investors in agriculture, arguing that this would target precisely those who are most likely to do the right thing.
One may ask whether transparency and the requirement that local landholders consent to a sale is enough to protect people living in poverty.
Supporters of free markets will argue that if local landowners wish to sell their land, that is their choice to make.&#160;
But, given the pressures of poverty and the lure of cash, what does it take for people to be able to make a genuinely free and informed choice about selling something as significant as a right to land?
After all, we do not allow poor people to sell their kidneys to the highest bidder.
Of course, hardline supporters of free markets will say that we should.
But, at the very least, it needs to be explained why people should be prohibited from selling kidneys, but not from selling the land that grows their food.
Most people can live without one kidney. No one can live without food.
Why does the purchase of body parts give rise to international condemnation, while the purchase of agricultural land does not – even when it involves evicting local landholders and producing food for export to rich countries instead of for local consumption?
The World Bank may indeed be more concerned about local landholders’ rights than other foreign investors are.
If so, the 21 complaints made against Bank projects are most likely the visible tip of a vast iceberg of violations of land rights by foreign investors in agricultural projects in developing countries – with the others remaining invisible because victims have no access to any complaint procedure.
One such case belatedly came to the attention of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
In November, the Committee concluded that Germany had failed to police the Neumann Kaffee Gruppe regarding its complicity in the forced eviction of several villages in Uganda to make way for a large coffee plantation.
But the evictions took place in 2001, and the villagers are still living in extreme poverty.
They found no remedy, in either Uganda or Germany, for the violation of rights that, according to the Committee, they possess under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Germany is a signatory.
Are we to believe that landholders fare better with Chinese or Saudi investors?
Israel versus America versus Iran
TEL AVIV – Israel’s concern about the specter of a nuclear Iran has now degenerated into a crisis of confidence concerning the United States.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has embarked on a campaign to force President Barack Obama to set a red line that Iran must not cross, lest it risk unleashing an American military response.
Implicit threats of a unilateral Israeli attack, together with conspicuous meddling in the US presidential election campaign, have compounded Netanyahu’s effort to twist Obama’s arm.
The controversy between the two allies partly reflects their divergent timelines: for Israel, the red line is Iran’s imminent burial deep underground of its uranium-enrichment facilities; for the US, it is the start of a dedicated weapons program.
But, equally important, the dispute underscores their different objectives.
For Israel, war with Iran is not about neutralizing an existential threat; it is about reasserting its regional status.
Israel’s leaders see their country’s standing in the region being seriously threatened by the emergence of a hostile Islamist regime in Egypt; the possibility that a similarly hostile regime will eventually emerge in Syria; the fragility of traditionally friendly Jordan; and the dangerous boost that the regional Islamist awakening has given to Israel’s sworn enemies, Hamas and Hezbollah.
Both Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak thus regard an attack on Iran as a major strategic move aimed at the broader Middle East, which implies that they would not discount a military campaign that goes well beyond surgical air strikes.
Indeed, they probably contemplate land incursions into Iran, and possibly a decisive –&#160;and, from their perspective, long overdue – showdown with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Though determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, even if doing so requires military action, the US weighs the consequences of a military showdown in very different terms.
A superpower that has earned only frustration in its abortive efforts – whether war or regional diplomacy – in the dysfunctional Middle East, the US faces the Iran crisis in the midst of its epochal strategic shift to Asia and the Pacific.
The fallout from a war in Iran would pin down the US in the Middle East for years to come, undermining its new strategic priorities.
As a result, the US, though certainly better equipped than Israel for a war to ensure that Iran forever abandons its nuclear ambitions, could nonetheless conclude that that objective is simply too costly.
The recent report by The Iran Project, whose signatories include the former US national security advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski, concluded that an American military attack on Iran could only delay its nuclear program for up to four years.
To guarantee that Iran never acquires a nuclear bomb, the US would need to maintain military pressure on Iran for several years.
And, if forced to impose regime change as the ultimate solution to the dilemma, the report assumes that this would require military occupation, which would entail a commitment of resources and personnel greater than what the US invested in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
Moreover, the conventional assumption that the region’s Sunni Arab regimes would give tacit approval to a military attack on Iran’s nuclear installations must be revisited in the wake of the Arab Spring – particularly in the aftermath of the recent, sudden upsurge in anti-American violence throughout the Muslim world.
The pre-Arab Spring paradigm that framed the Middle East as being divided between “moderates” and “extremists” has become obsolete.
The Islamist governments that have emerged from the downfall of America’s puppet regimes are no friends of an Iranian nuclear empire.
But, in their struggle to survive, they must channel popular anti-Americanism.
For Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, that imperative meant placating the angry mob that recently attacked the US embassy rather than merely condemning the violence.
An attack on Iran, especially if it develops into a longer war involving regional proxies, is bound to become the trigger for mass anti-Israel and anti-US hysteria, which might draw the Islamist regimes in the region into a dynamic of escalation.
It would be impossible to rule out a regional war.
The main problem facing a military operation in Iran is the need to ensure its legitimacy.
China and Russia would never allow the US to secure a United Nations mandate for an attack.
Moreover, while Iranian provocations that clearly reveal the regime’s intentions to develop a nuclear-weapons capability might help build support for American military action, it is far from certain that Europeans, or others, would rush to join another US-led “coalition of the willing.”
The dire legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan weighs heavily on the Western democracies.
The saddest part of the story is Israel’s utter indifference to the need to build international legitimacy for its drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program.
Netanyahu thinks in bold military terms, not in terms of geopolitical strategy.
His careless Palestine policy has left Israel with few friends in the international community, let alone in the Arab Middle East.
Indeed, many regard Netanyahu’s Iran obsession as nothing more than a successful ploy to divert attention from the Palestinian issue.
Only a generous, bold peace initiative that would genuinely revive the two-state solution, accompanied by a freeze on construction and enlargement of West Bank settlements, would help to recover the good will of the Palestinians and their brethren throughout the Arab world.
And only that outcome can secure the international goodwill that both Israel and the US will need for a showdown with Iran.
Aid Works
NEW YORK – The critics of foreign aid are wrong.
A growing flood of data shows that death rates in many poor countries are falling sharply, and that aid-supported programs for health-care delivery have played a key role.
Aid works; it saves lives.
One of the newest studies, by Gabriel Demombynes and Sofia Trommlerova, shows that Kenya’s infant mortality (deaths under the age of one year) has plummeted in recent years, and attributes a significant part of the gain to the massive uptake of anti-malaria bed nets.
These findings are consistent with an important study of malaria death rates by Chris Murray and others, which similarly found a significant and rapid decline in malaria-caused deaths after 2004 in sub-Saharan Africa resulting from aid-supported malaria-control measures.
Let’s turn back the clock a dozen years.
In 2000, Africa was struggling with three major epidemics.
AIDS was killing more than two million people each year, and spreading rapidly.
Malaria was surging, owing to the parasite’s growing resistance to the standard medicine at the time.
Tuberculosis was also soaring, partly as a result of the AIDS epidemic and partly because of the emergence of drug-resistant TB.
In addition, hundreds of thousands of women were dying in childbirth each year, because they had no access to safe deliveries in a clinic or hospital, or to emergency help when needed.
These interconnected crises prompted action.
The United Nations’ member states adopted the Millennium Development Goals in September 2000.
Three of the eight MDGs – reductions in children’s deaths, maternal deaths, and epidemic diseases – focus directly on health.
Likewise, the World Health Organization issued a major call to scale up development assistance for health.
And African leaders, led by Nigeria’s president at the time, Olusegun Obasanjo, took on the challenge of battling the continent’s epidemics.
Nigeria hosted two landmark summits, on malaria in 2000 and on AIDS in 2001, which were a crucial spur to action.
At the second of these summits, then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria.
The Global Fund began operations in 2002, financing prevention, treatment, and care programs for the three diseases.
High-income countries also finally agreed to reduce the debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries, allowing them to spend more on health care and less on crippling payments to creditors.
The United States also took action, adopting two major programs, one to fight AIDS and the other to fight malaria.
In 2005, the UN Millennium Project recommended specific ways to scale up primary health care in the poorest countries, with the high-income countries helping to cover the costs that the poorest could not pay by themselves. The UN General Assembly backed many of the project’s recommendations, which were then implemented in numerous low-income countries.
Donor aid did start to rise sharply as a result of all of these efforts.
In 1995, total aid for health care was around $7.9 billion.
This inadequate level then crept up slowly, to $10.5 billion by 2000.
By 2005, however, annual aid for health had jumped another $5.9 billion, and by 2010, the total had grown by another $10.5 billion, to reach $26.9 billion for the year.
The expanded funding allowed major campaigns against AIDS, TB, and malaria; a major scaling up of safe childbirth; and increased vaccine coverage, including the near-eradication of polio.
Many innovative public-health techniques were developed and adopted.
With one billion people living in high-income countries, total aid in 2010 amounted to around $27 per person in the donor countries – a modest sum for them, but a life-saving one for the world’s poorest people.
The public-health successes can now be seen on many fronts.
Around 12 million children under five years old died in 1990.
By 2010, this number had declined to around 7.6 million – still far too high, but definitely an historic improvement.
Malaria deaths in children in Africa were cut from a peak of around one million in 2004 to around 700,000 by 2010, and, worldwide, deaths of pregnant women declined by almost half between 1990 and 2010, from an estimated 543,000 to 287,000.
Another $10-15 billion in annual aid (that is, roughly $10-15 more per person in the high-income world), bringing total aid to around $40 billion per year, would enable still greater progress to be made in the coming years.
The MDGs for health could be achieved even in many of the world’s poorest countries.
Unfortunately, at every step during the past decade – and still today – a chorus of aid skeptics has argued against the needed help.
They have repeatedly claimed that aid does not work; that the funds will simply be wasted; that anti-malaria bed nets cannot be given to the poor, since the poor won’t use them; that the poor will not take anti-AIDS medicines properly; and so on and so forth.
Their attacks have been relentless (I’ve faced my share).
The opponents of aid are not merely wrong.
Their vocal antagonism still threatens the funding that is needed to get the job done, to cut child and maternal deaths by enough to meet the MDGs by 2015 in the poorest countries, and to continue after that to ensure that all people everywhere finally have access to basic health services.
A decade of significant progress in health outcomes has proved the skeptics wrong.
Aid for health care works – and works magnificently – to save and improve lives.
Let us continue to support these life-saving programs, which uphold the dignity and well-being of all people on the planet.
Truth and Consequences
NEW YORK – The recent re-election of Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, brings hope to a country seeking to end a half-century of conflict.
But, as with so many peace processes, finding a balance between creating a stable accord and acknowledging the terrible injustices that occurred during the conflict can be difficult to achieve.
Many countries and communities, from Nepal to Northern Ireland, have grappled with legacies of ethnic, ideological, or religious division and violence, often with limited success.
This is frequently the case because the mechanisms established to cope with post-conflict reconciliation, truth, and justice, have proved inadequate.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has made important contributions to truth seeking.
But victims complain that its procedures are slow and abstruse; and many Bosnian Serbs are convinced that the tribunal is selective and politically motivated.
An agreement between Nepal’s government and Maoist guerrillas to establish a truth commission and investigate the “disappeared” was delayed for seven years.
When legislators finally enacted the enabling legislation in May 2013, victims were dismayed to discover that the commission would be allowed to recommend amnesties for crimes against humanity, in contravention of international principles and United Nations guidelines.
In Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, justly acclaimed for staunching the bloodshed and starting reconciliation, has – to the great frustration of victims – run into political resistance over one integral element of the peace process: the establishment of mechanisms to clarify past crimes.
Peace negotiators understandably fear that criminal accountability for past crimes will threaten their side’s leaders and supporters.
Many have wrongly assumed – based on a misinterpretation of the South African experience – that truth commissions provide a “soft” alternative to justice.
As a result, they have willingly incorporated these mechanisms into peace agreements (conveniently ignoring the fact that the victims are forced to choose between seeking justice and learning the truth).
Predictably, as truth commissions have become established components of transitional justice, former fighters have become increasingly worried that their reputations and political credibility could be on the line should past crimes ever come to light.
Seeking the truth can be unsettling and painful for anyone, but it comes with serious consequences for those with reason to fear justice.
Indeed, conflict mediation and transitional justice rely on truth commissions as a fundamental building block of peace not because such commissions provide impunity for the worst crimes; on the contrary, they reinforce comprehensive rights-based policies and access to justice.
As a recent symposium, organized by the Kofi Annan Foundation and the International Center for Transitional Justice, concluded, truth commissions contribute most to peace by reasserting the rule of law, recognizing victims, and supporting institutional reform.
But, in order to succeed, these commissions must be effective, independent, and legitimate.
Half-measures will not do.
Truth commissions therefore should never be established as “box-ticking” exercises to assuage local public opinion or the international community, as witnessed in Nepal.
Even when broad mandates and functions are established with the best of intentions, truth commissions are often deprived of the necessary resources, leading to further frustration and disillusion.
Moreover, a commission should not be led or staffed by individuals of questionable integrity, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the process.
Above all, truth commissions must be adapted to a country’s particular circumstances.
As we have seen in Bosnia, Colombia, Nepal, Northern Ireland, and elsewhere, the nature of conflicts and how they are resolved differ widely; so should their respective commissions.
A “one-size-fits-all” solution ends up fitting no one.
It is vital that the details of each case of post-conflict transitional justice are understood and implemented.
It is all too easy for political leaders to ignore victims or suppress the truth in their quest for a peace deal.
But recognizing victims’ rights is an indispensable condition for lasting peace.
Human suffering and victims’ dignity are too powerful to be erased by others’ political pacts.
Eventually, the past demands its due: justice is not just an ideal; it is an investment in a better future.
Alan Greenspan on Trial
The release of Alan Greenspan’s ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all.
Stan Collender of National Journal sees the fingerprints of the White House on these attacks: Greenspan is harshly critical of George W. Bush’s administration, after all, and to attack the credibility of Republican ex-policymakers who are critical of Bush is standard counterpunching for it.
But what is one to make of the criticisms of Greenspan’s tenure at the Federal Reserve?
The indictment contains four counts: that Greenspan wrongly cheered the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages, which fueled the housing bubble; that he wrongly endorsed Bush’s tax cuts; that he should have reined in the stock market bubble of the 1990’s; and that he should have done the same with the real estate bubble of the 2000’s.
To the first two counts, Greenspan now pleads guilty.
He says that he did not understand how the growth of non-standard mortgages had lured borrowers and investors into bearing dangerous risks.
He was, he now says, focusing on how fixed-rate mortgages are relatively bad deals for borrowers in times of low inflation, which was a mistake.
Greenspan also pleads guilty to a mistake in early 2001.
He thought that he was giving balanced testimony to Congress on government budget issues.
He testified that it is important to run surpluses to pay down the debt, but that surpluses must not be so large that the government winds up owning American industry.
He also testified that tax cuts are better than spending increases to keep surpluses from growing too large, but that uncertainty is enormous, so that any tax cuts should be canceled if they threatened to bring us back to an age of deficits.
Robert Rubin and Kent Conrad warned him that the press would not interpret his testimony as being balanced, and that Congress would interpret it as an excuse to abandon fiscal discipline. They were right.
Greenspan also pleads guilty to misunderstanding the character of the Bush administration.
He thought that his old reality-based friends from the Ford administration were back in power.
He thought that he – and Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill – could win the quiet “inside game” for sensible policy without resorting to an “outside game” that would make his reappointment in 2004 unlikely.
He was wrong.
But how serious are these policy-political crimes to which Greenspan now pleads guilty?
In my view, they are misdemeanors.
Against them you have to set what former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calls Greenspan’s “golden glove” performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the Fed.
The “felonies” of which Greenspan stands accused are the other two charges: that he should have done more to stop the stock market bubble of the late 1990’s, and that he should have done more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000’s.
Here, Greenspan holds his ground, and pleads not guilty.
The only way, he says, for the Fed to have kept stock prices in reasonable equilibrium ranges in the late 1990’s would have been to raise interest rates so high that they hit the real economy on the head with a brick.
Interest rates high enough to curb stock market speculation would also have curbed construction and other forms of investment, raised unemployment, and sent the economy into recession.
To cause a significant current evil in order to avoid a possible future danger when our knowledge is limited and our judgments uncertain is, Greenspan believes, unwise.
In this, he is following a tradition of caution that extends from Edmund Burke to John Maynard Keynes.
Greenspan mounts a similar defense concerning the housing bubble.
High construction employment has been good for American workers in the past half-decade – a period that has not produced much good for them.
Higher interest rates to reduce the housing boom seem, even in retrospect, ill advised if the cost is mass unemployment.
And Greenspan eschews paternalism: he would not assume the role of a regulator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a lender is willing to finance it.
But Greenspan would have served the country and the world better if he had been somewhat more paternalist in slowing the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages.
He would have served the country and the world better had he been less of a loyal Republican working the inside game of trying to convince Bush’s political advisors that good policy was important, and more of a nonpartisan steward of America’s long-term fiscal stability.
Of course, such a Greenspan would never have been re-appointed.
All in all, Greenspan served the United States and the world well through his stewardship of monetary policy, especially by what he did not do: trying to stop stock and housing speculation by halting the economy in its tracks.
Alexander Hamilton’s Eurozone Tour
PRINCETON – Europe’s debt crisis has piqued Europeans’ interest in American precedents for federal finance.
For many, Alexander Hamilton has become a contemporary hero. Perhaps one day his face should appear on the €10 banknote.
Specifically, for European states groaning under unbearable debt burdens, Hamilton’s negotiation in 1790 of the new federal government’s assumption of the states’ large debts looks like a tempting model.
Indeed, after Thomas Sargent won the Nobel Prize in Economics last year, he cited it as a precedent in his acceptance speech.
Hamilton argued – against James Madison and Thomas Jefferson – that the debts accumulated by the states during the War of Independence should be assumed by the federation.
There were two sides to his case, one practical, the other philosophical.
Initially, the most appealing argument for his plan was that it would provide greater security to creditors, and thus reduce interest rates, from the 6% at which the states financed their debt to 4%.
Hamilton emphasized the importance of a commitment to sound finance as a prerequisite to public economy.
“When the credit of a country is in any degree questionable,” he argued, “it never fails to give an extravagant premium upon all the loans it has occasion to make.”
While that logic certainly appeals to Europeans today, Hamilton insisted on a stronger reason for pursuing sound finance than merely the pursuit of expediency.
There is, he maintained, “an intimate connection between public virtue and public happiness.”
That virtue consisted in honoring commitments, and it would build solidarity in the new political community of the United States.
Indeed, public virtue made federal finance what he called “the powerful cement of our union.”
The condition for success in the American case was that the US raised its own revenue, with federally administered customs houses initially providing the bulk of its receipts.
The logic of a need for specific revenue applies also in modern Europe, where a reformed fiscal system might include common administration of value-added tax (with the additional benefit of eliminating a considerable amount of cross-border fraud).
In the American case, however, unity carried a price: a ceiling was imposed on Virginia’s exposure to the common debt.
Only this inducement to the most powerful state in the union persuaded Madison to drop his opposition to the proposal.
That compromise (which also led to the US capital’s relocation to the District of Columbia, on the border of Virginia and Maryland) may serve as a precedent for limiting Germany’s liabilities if Eurobonds, or some other debt-mutualization scheme, are introduced.
The US experiment in federalized finance was not immediately successful.
Two important components of Hamilton’s financial architecture were not realized, or were realized imperfectly.
He proposed a model of joint-stock banking on a national scale, which ran into immediate opposition (curiously, his proposal was much more influential in Canada). Second, opponents eventually blocked his proposal for a national central bank.
The charter of the First Bank of the United States was allowed to lapse in 1811; a generation later, in 1836, President Andrew Jackson successfully opposed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States.
Nor did the Hamiltonian scheme of federal finance guarantee a peaceful commonwealth.
In fact, the fiscal union proved to be explosive rather than adhesive.
As international capital markets developed in the early nineteenth century, state governments borrowed on a large scale, quickly turning them from creditors into debtors.
A wave of state defaults followed in the late 1830’s.
A generation later, in the 1860’s, the Civil War between northern and southern states resulted in large part from a dispute about the character of financial burdens –amp at least from the South’s perspective.
Abraham Lincoln’s original proposal to end the immoral practice of slavery by compensating slave owners for manumission was unacceptably expensive, so the Union, according to the slave-holding Confederacy, was determined to expropriate the South.
The federal assumption of states’ debts by itself could not guarantee political order.
The Civil War revealed the centrality of a common foundation of morality to Hamilton’s approach to debt and public finance.
As a result, his approach foundered on the differences between the different states’ conception of morality.
Europeans today have latched onto the practical side of Hamilton’s argument – that is, the idea that debt mutualization might be a means to cheaper credit; but they have worked out neither the political institutions, nor the shared public virtue, that Hamilton deemed crucial.
The extended and politicized debate about debt restructuring has made a Hamiltonian solution more difficult, because the credit of the countries that would be party to it has become questionable.
An obvious starting point for a Hamiltonian Europe would be to set some standard limit for federalized national debt – perhaps the tarnished threshold of 60% of GDP that was mandated (without adequate enforcement) by the Maastricht convergence criteria, or perhaps a lower limit.
Debt exceeding that amount would be left to the responsibility of the member states.
Collective burden-sharing is in the long run the only non-catastrophic way out of Europe’s current crisis, but that requires a substantially greater degree of political accountability and control on a European level.
The lesson to be learned from Hamilton and the US is that the necessary institutions will not function without a greater degree of moral consensus as well.
How We Lose Our Marbles
ATHENS – George Clooney has reignited a longstanding debate after suggesting, in response to a Greek journalist’s question, that removing the Parthenon Marbles, known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles, from London’s British Museum and returning them to their ancient home in Athens would be “the right thing to do.”
In the early nineteenth century, the friezes and sculptures were removed from the Parthenon by Lord Elgin, Britain’s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.
Elgin sold them to the British government, which put them in the British Museum.
Greece wants them back.
The occasion for this latest round of historical jousting is the release of Clooney’s new film The Monuments Men, which details Allied efforts to rescue art works from the Nazis during World War II.
His comments infuriated London’s provocative mayor, Boris Johnson, himself a classics scholar and author, who shot back that Clooney’s position on the issue was similar to that of the Nazis portrayed in his film.
But the film is of less interest in this dispute than the identity of the characters involved.
Perhaps the most important question is this: Whom is the public inclined to believe – Clooney or Johnson (or perhaps the Nazis)?
Of course, one might ask why the people involved should matter at all; surely the facts of the case should speak for themselves.
And yet, on questions such as this – as with so many important political, social, economic, and cultural issues – what we come to believe is not based on the facts alone, if at all.
Sometimes we may indeed think deeply about the pros and cons of each argument, actively seeking information and data that would support one view over another; in other cases, however, we rely on a “quick and dirty” evaluation of the arguments, focusing not on evidence, but rather on an advocate’s expertise or popularity.
Social and cognitive psychologists have long understood these two basic processes in their study of “dual-process” models, which explain how we process information and eventually form an opinion. We take the peripheral route to information processing when buying, say, a toaster on a whim, whereas we take the so-called central route – thoroughly considering technical, safety, and aesthetic features – when buying a car.
The systematic study of persuasion began during World War II, when the US Army recognized that fighting a nation mesmerized by Hitler would require bolstering troop motivation and rallying popular support for the war.
They sought help from Yale University psychologist Carl Hovland and his associates, who produced what has become a well-known model of persuasion, comprising three groups of variables related to the communicator, the audience, and the message.
Hovland drew upon ideas dating back to Aristotle’s Rhetoric, which argued that persuasiveness is built on the communicator’s ethical character, the audience’s emotional state, and the logic of the argument, the latter being the most powerful.
Psychological research has shown that any one of these three can be persuasive, depending on the speaker’s attractiveness or the audience’s predisposition.
For example, star-struck female film fans may be especially prone to believe any utterance from Hollywood’s most famous silver fox.
Or, in the case of the Nazis, fear may predispose the audience to be persuaded.
But in most cases, when people are confronted with matters of great importance, they are more likely to use the so-called central route to information processing, and rightly so.
Issues of world cultural heritage, for example, deserve conscious, thoughtful deliberation of the facts.
Indeed, it is our duty, and the very basis of any successful civilization, that important decisions are made only after scrutinizing all relevant information and weighing the relative merits of every position.
Once that duty has been fulfilled, a logical person will understand that the Parthenon Marbles, long held by a former imperial power’s flagship museum, were violently severed from the rest of the Parthenon sculptures – an outrage against art and an unhealed scar inflicted by the British on the long-suffering Greek people.
At that point, only one conclusion is possible: The plundered Marbles must be reunited in their historical home and exhibited to the world as the ancient artists intended.
Persuaded? Perhaps not – I am Greek, after all.
But do not take Clooney’s word for it, either (or Johnson’s).
Deciding the disposition of the world’s cultural patrimony is not like buying a toaster.
A Sunni-Shia Bridge Too Far
BAGHDAD – Iraq’s recent parliamentary election, the first since United States troops left the country in 2011, was held amid a rising tide of violence that is fast approaching the levels experienced during the 2005-2007 insurgency.
Can the new government restore order and address the many immense challenges that Iraq faces?
The challenges are indeed daunting.
The authorities must resolve fundamental constitutional questions (such as whether Iraq should be a federal state or a confederation), rebuild civil society, reform state institutions, reconstruct the economy, and end the waste and corruption in the oil sector.
But perhaps the most intractable challenge of all is bridging the sectarian rift between the country’s Shia and Sunni citizens.
These fissures are mirrored in other Arab countries (such as Syria, Lebanon, the Gulf countries, and Yemen) and, increasingly, in the wider Muslim world (including Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia).
Is this a historical aberration, or are Islam’s two largest sects condemned to perpetual mutual hostility?
Certainly, there have been periods when the two communities have coexisted peacefully.
But what matters today is that Shia and Sunni relate to their past differently, and that this historical memory can be distorted – and even invented – to create mistrust and hate.
The overthrow of the first Muslim dynasty, the staunchly anti-Shia Umayyads, in the year 750, by the Abbasids, who traced their lineage to the Prophet Muhammad’s uncle, raised hopes, albeit short-lived, of a Sunni-Shia rapprochement.
The 500 years of Abbasid reign that followed provide many valuable illustrations of how these two communities subsequently related to each other.
In particular, there is much to be learned from the different legacies of the caliph al-Nasir (1180-1225) and the last Abbasid caliph, al-Musta’sim (1242-1258).
The rule of al-Nasir – who viewed the Shia as an intrinsic part of the Islamic community and sought to treat all of his subjects equally – was characterized by a marked decrease in sectarian tensions.
By contrast, Sunni-Shia clashes – including killings, arson, and other violence – were common during al-Musta’sim’s rule.
These examples demonstrate the importance of good leadership when communities that uphold different claims to the truth are subject to the same political authority – especially when these communities seek assurance that their survival is not threatened.
Iraq’s current political leaders need to learn from this past and ensure that none of the country’s communities face marginalization or discrimination – lessons that apply throughout the Muslim world.
In Pakistan, for example, there are sectarian killings almost daily; in Malaysia, the tiny Shia population is viewed as an existential threat; and incendiary language dominates discourse about rival sects in Wahhabi circles in Saudi Arabia and far beyond.
Politics and power struggles explain much of the violence and mistrust.
Fear of Iranian-led hegemony, for example, has focused Gulf leaders’ minds on their Shia population’s loyalty.
Malaysia’s political parties use anti-Shia animus to spread fear, helping to attract votes and consolidate power.
Syria and its regional allies are determined to protect a new regional balance of power that shifted in their favor following the US-led invasion of Iraq.
But political calculation cannot explain everything.
The fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 provides a good example of how a political event, viewed through a sectarian lens, can be interpreted differently.
The US destruction of the Iraqi state brought about a precarious new order that sought to redress years of Sunni dominance by favoring the Shia.
However, the shock of sudden Sunni disempowerment generated a discourse, widely shared in the Muslim world, in which the Shia are guilty of collusion in the US occupation of the country – a view reinforced by events in Syria.
According to this thesis, the Shia simply reverted to their “historic” role as wreckers and fifth columnists.
Was it not the case, it is claimed, that the Shia also colluded with the Mongols in the fall of Baghdad in 1258, culminating in the death of the last Abbasid caliph and the destruction of the Abbasid Empire, the “universal state” of Muslims?
Several medieval Muslim historians pointed to the role of the Shia vizier Ibn al-‘Alqami, arguing that he plotted with the Mongols to bring down the caliphate.
Once the preserve of a handful of scholars, the Ibn al-‘Alqami story now plays a prominent part in today’s Sunni- Shia disputes.
Indeed, “‘Alaqima,” the plural form of the Arabic name “‘Alqami,” is now applied to the Shia as short-hand for treachery.
Social media forums are replete with polemics about the Shia role in assisting both Mongol and US invaders.
Many even claim that Iraq’s Shia are al-‘Alqami’s descendants, and that Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq’s Prime Minister, is his modern incarnation.
These diatribes reflect Iraqi’s polarized historical memory.
Despite ample historical evidence of peaceful inter-communal relations, many people – whether through simple ignorance of history or the need to assert the supremacy of one version of the truth – prefer to consecrate narratives of treachery and betrayal that perpetuate hatred.
More important, the current situation reflects a lack of wisdom, responsibility, and basic decency on the part of political and religious leaders, who prefer to fuel, rather than dampen, inter-communal strife. Sadly, intolerance has now become a generalized condition.
There is too little knowledge about other communities’ beliefs and history, and what little exists has been overwhelmed by sectarian anger and its poisonous rhetoric.
As long as Sunnis and Shia refuse to think about their past together, it is difficult to foresee a tranquil future together.
And if political and religious leaders are unable or unwilling to seek accommodation, it will be up to like-minded individuals, groups, and civil-society institutions to rebuild mutual respect and find ways to cooperate.
Doing so will require knowledge, patience, and, above all, open minds and hearts.
All for One Tax and One Tax for All?
CAMBRIDGE – When the next full-scale global financial crisis hits, let it not be said that the International Monetary Fund never took a stab at forestalling it.
Recently, the IMF proposed a new global tax on financial institutions loosely in proportion to their size, as well as a tax on banks’ profits and bonuses.
The Fund’s proposal has been greeted with predictable disdain and derision by the financial industry.
More interesting and significant are the mixed reviews from G-20 presidents and finance ministers. Governments at the epicenter of the recent financial crisis, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, are downright enthusiastic, particularly about the tax on size.
After all, they want to do that anyway.
Countries that did not experience recent bank meltdowns, such as Canada, Australia, China, Brazil, and India, are unenthusiastic.
Why should they change systems that proved so resilient?
It is all too easy to criticize the specifics of the IMF plan.
But the IMF’s big-picture diagnosis of the problem gets a lot right. Financial systems are bloated by implicit taxpayer guarantees, which allow banks, particularly large ones, to borrow money at interest rates that do not fully reflect the risks they take in search of outsized profits.
Since that risk is then passed on to taxpayers, imposing taxes on financial firms in proportion to their borrowing is a simple way to ensure fairness.
“What risks?” the financial firms demand to know.
The average cost of the bailouts was “only” a few percentage points of GNP. And the crisis was a once-in-a-half-century event.
The IMF rightly points out that these claims are nonsense.
During the crisis, taxpayers were on the hook for almost a quarter of national income.
Perhaps the next crisis will not turn out so “well,” and the losses borne by the public will be staggering.
